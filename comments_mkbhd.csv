"The fact that this is your second most viewed video of all time in the history of your channel (25 million within a four week time period at the time of posting this comment) says a lot about the popularity of this product. You’ve made a lot of brilliant videos in the many years you’ve been on this platform, and you gained 25 million views on this insanely fast, and it says a lot. Absolute insanity. Obviously the amount of views gained in this case is not just down to the popularity of the product, but it’s also down to the popularity of you. You’ve always made high-quality, informative, well produced and well edited videos. I love that your main goal is to inform customers of everything they need to know before making purchases or even after making purchases. You were a good egg. Keep up the hard work and I say that not just yourself Mark but to your entire team. Thank you for all you do.",74
One of the best tech reviews ive ever seen. i wasn't bored a bit and half and hour passed like it was 10 to 12 minute. great video as always,58
23:00 unfortunately wearing the Vision Pro will likely also start an annoying awkward conversation too lol,29465
Peak MKBHD is describing the real sensation of his finger and thumb making contact as ‘haptic feedback’ 😂😂,6058
Definitely one of the most in-depth an informative reviews I have ever seen on anything whatsoever.  You so very clearly relayed the experience and nature of the Vision Pro.  I had absolutely no idea what this gadget was about since I've had very limited exposure to VR but now I get it.  Thank you for the amazing walk-through.,8
One of the best reviews I’ve watched in a very long time. Thank you!,16
If I buy one of them I would forget to close all the window and like 20 tabs would be distributed in my house 😂😂😂,3403
This man’s house/set is the environment in which Apple intends everyone to live and use their products.,3166
One of the best video I watched. I like how you were able to provide a lot of details about this product. I am definitively getting one Apple Visio Pro. Thank you!,2
My brother in law was the manager of the Apple Vision Pro and he is very proud of it!,12

"Your review is great! Straight to the point, in-depth enough, very sharp. Thanks!",1
That direction of the caller's voice is a game changer I've been waiting to come. It helps our brains to decipher information who's talking and what when there are multiple voices in a group call.,15
The screens casting a shadow is a really nice touch,1729

"Ngl, im not an apple fan BUT my mum has recently lost the use of 3 of her 4 limbs. The idea of her being able to navigate a computer with her usable hand is INCREDIBLE as she cant really text at the moment as she has very poor fine motor control but can pinch her fingers together! This could mean she can text her friends and navigate her apps and games etc far more! <3 The accessibility- taking eye tracking to the public - the possibilities for disabled individuals is HUGE!",1918

"23:13 I LOVE the idea of someone sitting next to you on the plane, having no idea what a Vision Pro is, and just seeing you touching a trackpad and keyboard on a laptop that seemingly isn't on 😂. Absolute madman behaviour. Great video as always 👍",837
I am super impressed with your video and with the tech. Both are best-in-class.,0
"these are absolutely awesome, tech is definitely improving wow",1
"Talking about immersion, I started watching this video thinking I won’t be able to finish it; and it’s a rare thing to make a 40 min video feel this seamless. Literally didn’t realise when it got over. This has got to be one of the best tech videos uploaded by Marques, or anyone for that matter.",585

Damn this video was really interesting and super well edited! Thank you for the immersive experience 😊,1
WOw! That Full Immersion dial switch is just 🤯 Mind blowing. Great product. Already,0
The amount of R&D this must have gone through is insane. Kudos to the engineers.,667
Man...imaging an unskippable ad in the headset. And the ad will pause unless it detects that your eyes are watching/focusing on the ad...fun stuff,339
Wonderful overview. I just did the demo at the Apple Store and you really added a LOT to my understanding.,0
This was one of the best reviews I’ve ever seen. I want this thing so bad now after watching this video. So many cool features,0
"37 minutes, and he says wait for the full review. 😂",147
"22:59 i think it would be easier to explain to the passengers beside you that you are a YouTuber, rather then explaining the vision pro 😂",719
Excellent breakdown. Probably won’t be able to ever try but super cool to experience it a bit through your eyes. Really great breakdown. 🤙,0
"Great review, Marques. Greetings all the way from Morocco.",0
Imagine watching “you know what” on the Apple Vision Pro and suddenly your buddy’s face shows up from the mist just because you are looking at his general direction 😂,814
"No YouTube, No Netflix, No Spotify…literally the only 3 apps I could think of myself using with this thing (at least, currently) 😭😭",1301
"Marques delivers an exceptional breakdown of the Vision Pro, showcasing its remarkable features and potential applications with unparalleled clarity. His thorough examination of the device's capabilities, particularly the innovative eye and hand tracking technology, highlights its revolutionary impact on the VR landscape. 

While addressing the downsides of the Vision Pro, including its weight, battery life, and current app selection, Marques maintains an objective and balanced perspective, ensuring viewers receive a comprehensive evaluation. His insightful analysis encourages critical thinking and fosters meaningful discussion about the future of VR technology.

Marques, this is the first time I've seen a video of yours.  18.4 million subscribers?  Wow.",1
9 days old video and already your second most popular video ever. Crazy and well done Marques 👍,0
The people sitting next to you on the airplane are going to have even more questions when you are staring right at them trying to change the song 😂,947
“If it’s a URL you can actually say out loud” 😂😂,381
After watching your full review. I finally decided to keep my old phone as I realizef it gives me more immersion and control just by holding my phone in front of my face. Saves me 3500 as well,0
"Amazing review, will help me make an informed decision on this device in the future!",0
"I have no plans of buying this, but just thinking about the engineering that went into this device makes my brain dumb. I’m taking a controls systems class in college rn and it’s given me a new found appreciation for this kinda stuff. Props to apple for even trying this, genuinely some of the most impressive tech we’ve seen in a long time.",639
"Not an interior designer, but I can just tell that an app giving you a realistic depiction of a room with your proposed furniture would be absolutely killer. Same for architects and all kinds of designers.",806
Was an amazing overview loved how the shadow appeared under window. Unfortunately after 3 fittings I had to return mine as it kept putting pressure on my sinuses and would give me a pressure headache. I'm sure this is not everyone's experience I hope it gets resolved so I can get anyone.,0
"How far we've come... really impresses me the fact we can do all these things and keep going to a 100% virtual world, which is kinda scary btw. Nice video man, really appreciate your effort on ti!",1
"LMAO the praying hands gesture of tim cook 18:36 xD 
edit: this is my first 1k 🙏 xD",1049
"When I started watching this, I thought, ""there's no way I'm gonna make it through a forty-minute review of a product I don't even want."" But Marques does such an amazing job of illuminating the pros and cons of this product, putting in context what matters and what doesn't, that the time went by like nothing. It's gonna take a lot more to convince me that I actually need this product, but it does look like fun. Also like a recipe for neck strain and migraines. Still, this is one of the best product reviews I've ever watched and I look forward to more of Marques's insights.",1013
thx for the helpful introduction!!,0
"Very interesting video, thanks for breaking it all down.  I'm not an apple guy, in fact I rather loth their walled garden ecosystem but I can appreciate a good piece of tech.  I'm glad they put out such a well polished headset, hopefully it will get a few other manufacturers to step up their game.",0
"15:02 ""If it`s a URL that, you know, you can actually say out loud"".  😂😂😂😂",288

Great review! Thanks for sharing.,0
"15:00 “If it’s a url that, you know, you can actually say out loud.” LMAO",367
"""if its a URL you can say out loud"".  flew over my head for a second lol",661
Great video. Well done. I also like that while you’re talking apple integration you’re featuring a Samsung phone for your video notes.,0
"I acidentally stumbled upon your review. Being a tech fan, I watched it from beginning to the end very carefully. I must compliment and praise your way of presenting this gadget. It's fun and interesting to watch, and your diction is very good so I didn't need to turn on subtitles, which I usually do when I'm not wearing my hearing aid device. Regarding product, no way I am paying this price. Once V2 comes out with less weight, better battery life and better battery solution overall, as well as with more acceptable price, I might consider it. In the meantime, I've subbed to your channel and looking forward for more reviews done by you. Thanks bro!",5
Marques channeling his inner Tim Cook at 18:34 is unintentionally hilarious,610
"23:33 ""when you try it,you'll see what i mean"" No Marques I won't,I'M BROKEE!😂",431
Well Done!  It was a pleasure watching.  Thanks!,0
thank you for this review.,1
I really enjoy your way of speaking. So clean,0
"*Going to Mars becomes a possibility*

17:55 Hey Marques im glad you liked the Alfa Romeo F1 car I made for Jigspace! I'm a big fan of your work too :D,924
Dude... the best review I've seen of this yet... sweet i have not liked Apple products before very much but this one... seems pretty dang fun... the price though... dayum... might have to wait a bit but... you definitely seem to have sold it to me!,0
"Jig space on Apple Vision Pro is sooooo cool, wish I was having my own headset right now seeing all this 🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎",0
You deserve your view count. There was no time wasting filler and stupid humour in this. Just well presented information. Thank you. It's a breath of fresh air.,740
"Bro, you just held me hostage for 30+ minutes at 4am 😂 I didn’t think I’d watch 3 minutes. Well done as always, mate.",651
The conferencing capability is really cool. And makes total sence. For companys big telepresence system like a Cisco TX9000 or Poly RealPresence are around half a million dollars excluding installation (and use for the room). So this is super interesting. And of course the usual AR/VR training and presentation use cases.,0
🔥🔥🔥 appreciate this video,0
"NGL, memes aside, this is what I felt like VR in future would always look like. The dismantling of the car and constellation just blew me away. Literally felt like I was watching a SCI-FI movie",351
21:53 The irony of having a Windows wallpaper on your MacBook made me LOL,356
anyway you explain and discuss very well. WELL DONE Better than any talk show host or tv presenter well done,0
You make brilliant content. Subscribed+,0
"Credit to you for making a video on a product i have no interest in buying, and make me watch most of it.

"as a former valve index user and a meta quest 3 fan, I find this headset incredibly well made considering this is apple's first ar/vr headset, imagine this 3 gens later",277
I so appreciate a product review that doesn't feel like an ill-concealed ad.,0
This video was the inspiration for me making a video about the Apple Vision Pro ngl,0
This is the only guy who can review new gear without sounding like he’s trying to sell it to you.  I have respect for Marques because he never seems to have an ego or arrogance despite having so much influence and viewers.,579

"4:35 I think the small number of mAh is because the Vision Pro's battery runs at 12v whereas ""usual"" battery bank for your phone runs at 3.5v. That's why compared to Vision Pro battery, the Anker one at 4:45 has 4x the mAh but only 20% larger Wh.",437

Very cool video so far! I'll come back to it and comment some more later.,0
Those Tim Cook hands on the stage got me 😆,237
"The thing I like about Apple is they've been such forward thinkers, so I think ""spatial computing"" is a really good name for this technology. Just the features with the facetime calls or zoom meetings makes you wonder how good it'll be once the vision 2 or 3 comes out. By that time there will probably be more app capability",0
5:21 I watched a video that showed 2 ways to turn it off. 1) go to settings then general and select Turn Off at the very bottom or 2) press and hold both the digital crown and the camera button until you see the turn off slider in front of you.,0
"18:34 love how Marques does the Tim Cook ""good morning"" hands on Steve Jobs Theater stage XD",640

Now the awkward plane encounter will be you staring at the person next to you  pinching your fingers with this big headset on 😂,675

"this ""VR"" just awesome 😂",1
I am not in Apple's ecosystem. But I cannot deny this device is pretty darn impressive. That Mac Virtual Display feature is bananas. I want to see this device succeed and actually push the industry forward and have similar features from 3rd parties.,216
"I know I’ll never buy this but being a motorsport fan, at 17:48 that just brought the inner child out of me 😂",488
I recon this would be epic for Pokémon Go. Imagine walking down the street and seeing a Gym or Poké stop in 3D you can interact with and Pokémon running out in front of you.,1
35:33 nice ad marques you think you slick with these subliminal ad placements 😂😂,1
"4:44 I'm surprised nobody on your team caught this - but the battery IS actually the equivalent of a 10,000 mAh battery bank - you can see it right there on the screen. The difference is most power banks are  around 3.7V (so a 10,000mAh capacity = 37Wh) and this one is likely around 12V (so a 3,166mAh capacity = 36Wh). It's right there on the screen!",102

"the screen recorded footage really shocked me, its by far the best POV footage I've ever seen on my 2D screen. it looks unreal",122
Can you use the eye tracking/finger pinchy thing instead of the trackpad on your Mac?,0
"I think I see where this is going. The vision pro will become an accessory to smaller, portable mac computers; they're liking keeping the battery separate to train their customers to get used to carrying something around. A separate computer piece would allow versatility in how it's used; both VR/AR and desktop modes, as well as allow the actual headset to shrink and become more comfortable.",0

"As a remote worker, this functionality (especially FaceTime) could be a total gamechanger that makes Apple much more relevant in a corporate environment. Imagine augmenting FaceTime with a presentation mode or virtual conference room. Could reduce the need for international travel. Even one less trip a year pays for this product.",0
In 2008 the best app we had was a torch that lit up on the phone and in the cameras flash. We are back with the ux leap that VR is just the equivalent to an iPhone without 3G,537
"Seen many videos on it, but I always love how you break things down.",341
Its Amazing!,0
"You said it calibrates to your eyes? Will it be able to do that through the lenses of my glasses? Is there enough room to accommodate a pair of glasses without touching the inside of the Vision Pro lens? Or would I need to switch to contact lenses? When I wear contacts, they are bifocal contacts. Will these work? I'm far sighted with astigmatism.",0
31:40 Thanks for the profile pic Marques,31
What is also really impressive is that the integrated screen recording has a solid image stabilization. On most other headsets you can see it quite shaking and it makes the viewers uncomfortable,92

"Hey Marques!  I actually have a lot of experience developing displays with lenticular lenses on them.  Theres a few things to note here.  A lenticular display has to encode the image into different viewing perspectives.  This can be done a few different ways.  You can split the image into 2 points of view and use depth sensing head/eye tracking to displace and skew the perspective of what you are viewing to emulate 3D depth for each eye, or you can split the image into a certain specific viewing angle.  Lets say you are using a 45 degree viewing angle, this would require you to split the image into 45 different points of view.  The benefit of this approach is that instead of emulating depth perception with head/eye tracking, anyone who views the monitor can see the same image from a different point of view.  The pitfall of this is the artifact you are experiencing with the blurry non distinct eyes.  When splitting an image into 45 degrees not only are you limiting your depth perception to the y-axis due to the physical restraints of the lenticular lens, but you also run into the issue of an extremely shallow focal plane.  Theres many reasons that this happens and I could go on for hours about the properties of lightfields, however I'll spare you some time and explain how this relates to your issue.  They simply are pushing the 3D model of your persona too far back in z space, and the focal plane is not properly calibrated (or cannot be with the definition display they have paired with their lens.)  This can be solved in software if the lenticular monitor is laminated correctly and it is on a very high definition display, but with a lower quality display and mismatched ppi many issues arise .  When designing a lenticular encoder to break your image into 45 viewing angles you must check the ppi of the lens.  The ppi is a value that specifies the size of each bump on the lens and the population of bumps on the surface.  When creating a lenticular monitor you want to make sure there is a high pixel density under each bump to avoid prism artifacts.  Each bump needs to encapsulate ALL 45 VIEWS!  On the encoded image that can look very odd, but I highly recommend looking up what holographic movie posters look like before they are laminated with lenticular lenses.  It'll give you a better idea of what I mean.  If a bump is not aligned with the calibrated encoded image a blurry low resolution doubling effect can occur or the lens may break up some white light into different colors creating  unintentional chromatic aberration in different areas of your diminished image.  You also want to ensure you don't use a lens with a value ppi that results in bumps that are clearly visible.  The lower the pixel density under each bump in the lens the lower the resolution of your hologram.  The larger the bumps are across your lenticular lens the lower the quality of your illusion.  Apple here is trying to use a lenticular lens with a very small bumps to have the screen appear as flat as possible for up-close viewing, however the display it is laminated on may not be high definition enough to support the resolution people expect.  If you pair that with a shallow focal plane and bad calibration your image is essentially garbage.  If you really want to dig into this technology and how it works I highly recommend picking up a Looking Glass portrait and tearing it apart.  You will see exactly what Apple is doing wrong.  You'll also notice with the Looking glass that although the display is decently high quality, the images always appear pixelated because of the bumps.  A certain distance away from the monitor is required for your brain to ignore them properly.",105
"I think the 3D augmented reality of 1:1 scale objects is the best feature of this headset.

"This is amazing.
Still a little rudimentary, but at least a massive step in the right direction.

I imagine that this will end up being the Google Glass that Google glass wasn't.
A simpler, sleeker version of it appearing a few years from now.
Hopefully, by then, they will have ironed out the smaller things like multiple finger typing and the Somewhat creepy Avatars...

I hope this does really well.",0
"You missed the best feature: capturing and playing back spacial video of your friends/family/kids. That's the killer ""game changing"" app. You can relive your own moments in immersive 3D like you are there again. Also missed pointing out that iPhone 15Pro can record spacial video format for Vision Pro. Admittedly at a lower resolution than the Vison Pro itself captures spacial video.",0
"My jaw dropped when you hooked it to the Mac and had a virtual display.  My mind went racing to all the possibilities of having multiple virtual hi-res displays for the price of one VisionPro, then it all came crashing down when you said it was limited to one display.  Dang.  Hopefully, Apple opens that little feature up and Pros can have virtual displays.  That'll be a great feature.",169
"""Technically it's not AR"" oh my goodness thank you for saying this. No joke, people calling seeing a camera feed of outside the glasses ""AR"" has been a real bugbear of mine.  I think with comparisons with the Hololens, Microsoft used the term ""Mixed Reality"" or MR to define what I guess Apple is calling ""Spatial Computing"". Gonna be really interesting seeing how this product develops and particularly how the next model builds on it or trims it down for a wider audience price point.",181
"The Missing Piece: a review of what happens if you use VR for an extended time, especially for full-time work environments. Back in the 1990's I was at a seminar featuring Maxine Brown of UIC's ImmersaDesk. Wearing no headset, and seated at a non-VR table, she was unable to speak without her hands floating around her, memory-driven, as if plucking information within her VR space. Now ... I test at 99% Spatial Reasoning, and would adore using VR for everything ... but having seen her inability to disengage her body enough to retrieve thoughts and vocalize without that accompanying physical mimic ... made me realize I would never really want to go down such a virtual rabbit hole when I already enjoy an internal spatial vr-type-ability on my own. I felt sad for her artificial VR tick, but also felt free and at peace for myself over a technology I'd (needlessly) yearned over for decades.,",1
"I'm not in the Apple environment and I'm not going to drop the kind of cash to pick one of these up but the design is truly impressive. Really well thought out and excellent execution. Does it work for people who are long or short sighted and would normally need glasses?

What would be really impressive would be a fully immersive map app that can overlay the real world and give you directions. If that app can also adjust light levels so you can basically see in the dark like a cat then it would break reality in the best way.

I'm looking forward to 20 years from now and we'll probably have something the size and weight of Google glass but all the functionality of the Vision Pro and integrates AI seamlessly. Just walking down the street and your AI assistant reminds you to pick up something your wife asked you for earlier that evening as you walk past a grocery store. Then you hear a song coming from a store you're walking past and you ask the AI what it's called and it tells you and starts playing it. You're thirsty and it suggests a juice bar nearby and overlays foot prints out in front of you to direct you. You walk past a scrolling news headline and you ask the AI to read out some of the stories as you walk. Then the battery dies and you realise you can't remember where you parked and simply forgot how to function without a headset since everyone does everything through them.",0

21:58 actually the virtual screens are quite certainly not having a 4K resolution unless you move them so close that a single screen fills up the entire FOV of the Vision Pro.

"Thanks for all the details. I am super interested in the eye alignment and tracking for the device, same for the correction ability/focus. I know prescription lenses can be ordered for the device through Zeiss but I wonder how it will work if you have limited vision, such as people with only one eye (monocular) or if someone has amblyopia (lazy eye). I also wonder how it tracks the eyes if someone has limited eye movements - such as Duanes syndrome/ brown syndrome or other limitations. 
There are already some medical tools that can track the eyes and help measure and diagnose eye alignment issues and I wonder if this device may be even more accurate for that. 
Considering the price tag, perhaps this technology will be easily adopted by the medical industry. Thoughts? 

Of course, then there is the question if long-term use will influence eye health/ myopia development, especially in young children. Would be awesome to get some of the eye care professionals from the dev team to talk about these questions.

Wh is the most accurate measure of battery capacity in a device, higher voltage gives higher Wh for the same mAh. All phones I know of use only 1 cell so voltage is the same which makes mAh an accurate measure for phones. But in the vision pro battery there are more cells so more voltage are more Wh than in IPhone even though the mAh is low.",113

Ive watched reviews from all the big guys Marques was chatting with but I'll tell you why Marques' review is always better.

Great review, I am not exactly an Apple fan and have a lot of issues with their anti-consumer ecosystem and pricing, but I will give them this: Their M1 and M2 series chips are pretty revolutionary technology in terms of their almost unprecedented level of power relative to space and power consumption, and that kind of ARM based compact and powerful technology is probably gonna be the future in terms ofenabling things like standalone AR/VR headsets that don't need you to connect them to a high end gaming computer to have a decent experience. My gf got an M1 Pro Macbook and god damn is it a nice laptop. Super powerful, great battery life, nice operating system, way better display than any Windows laptop in that price range.",0

2nd most popular video on your channel must be a 10/10 vid,1
Was so excited for u to talk about the movie/cinema experience... hope u will cover it next video,47
"Yoooo, at 29:05 bro your face just says it all about this experience 🤣😭💀",177
can you type on a real physical keyboard while using the viz pro?,0
But what if you have like a eye problem like needing glasses to see near objects. Wouldn't that affect wearing a Vision pro?,0
18:36 the Tim Cook prayer hands made me laugh so much,240

"Marques, you are so good at speaking clearly and interestingly. No unnecessary words, just amazing. I'm not even that interested in the product by I watched the whole video just because you're so captivating.",87
"Why not add a **tap by elevating your upper eyelid (staring)** feature ? Maybe wouldn't be comfortable to use for long times but it would very practical while using hands for something else
And glide typing would be very nice too with the pinched fingers of course",0

"The thing I always say is that people need to start learning ASL. Not only is it an able inclusive exercise to learn to be able to communicate with the deaf and speech impaired but it is also the single best way to input data using a hand tracking vr headset. For example, the ASL for menu is literally putting your hands together and opening them like a book, then with your right hand tracing three lines down across your palm in the air. You need to quickly fire out a text or email, just sign it. So many good applications.",62
Have you or anyone with one tried to use it to decorate a room let's say. Can you take furniture from a pic or store etc.. and place it into the room to see what it will look like?,0
"You know what would be really cool? Some sort of haptic gloves to make the augmented reality even more “real.” 
Somehow, while wearing the gloves, when you reach out to something, you actually feel like you’re holding or touching an object - via some ‘constraining’ or ‘vibratory effect’ within the gloves.",0
18:36 Those Cook-Hands. Epic! *lmao*,86
I watched another review yesterday and this video compared to that is night and day there’s a reason why this channel is the go to for tech the price is out my reach but you did a great job showing what it would be like to put this on wow !,27
im sure down the track they will impliment new features that are entirly unheard of today anddifferent uses that the vision can be used for,0
I fully support this technology it will advance beyond our imagination and its useful for military truck drivers even welders if it can increase enough tint,0
"That fade in environment feature would also be great for remote meetings. Imagine working from home, and you need to watch your kids while also needing to be present to, well, present and draw on a virtual whiteboard. Imagine being able to look around and engage your audience in the same manner as if you were physically there.",182
These are going to be perfect for snowboarding lmao,214
One step closer to the oasis from ready player one lol😅. Can’t wait for it,1

"Interesting video. Thanks. I am informed. But, i reckon it would be annoying to sit next to someone on a plane pinching at space the whole trip. 😵‍💫🤣",0
"itd be cool if they made it so you could lock what ur looking at and then look elsewhere and still controll what u were lookin at. maybe like a double click with the other hand, or making a fist while lookin at it",0
"You do this so well.  Tech stuff can be so ultra geeky and overwhelming, and you just calmly explain the parts that really matter to users.  Well done.  I so appreciate your videos.  Thank you.",53
"This is the type of VR that my generation ""born in the 80s"" has been waiting for. VR for us is like flying cars for the 50s generation. Its something I grew up with that was represented in movies and popular culture, but the technology wasnt there, and there were a few that came out that fell very short. If you were like me and had the original Virtual Boy you know what im talking about haha. But to see something like this, in reality, that works is just amazing.",111
i will be on it from gen3,0
I was truly surprised on the lack of streaming video apps like Netflix and others. You would think that would be a key feature for the headset.,0
"I've seen a comment on the first apple vision pro video that it's the ""closest thing to black mirror episode"", well, this video solidifies it, especially the persona thing",155
"I have no idea why, but the persona setup made me laugh so hard. He just smiled and it beeped then started talking 😂",129
So what if you open netflix on your mac then get the vision pro conected to the mac 🤔,0
"Looks to me lke impressive new technology that has yet to be seen what its potential is, honestly for me all these features feel more novelty than actually useful, then again, im not a mac user, i own nothing of mac, number of reasons, big one tho is how much an effort mac makes to eliminate all an any cross compatibilities",0
The Mac connectivity feature is insane!,40
"You sir, may be the king of reviews.  This is my first one I literally stumbled across from you and you got a ""subscribed"" a few mins in.  This is surprisingly efficient.",117
"A thumb-up rule for Apple new things is go for the second gen. That’s why I had iPod mini 2, iPod nano 2, iPad 2, iPhone 3G, with the only exception being MacBook Pro 16 2021 which was the first gen of this size, apple silicon and mini-led, as for which I’d say I could have been better to know something earlier.",0
Very cool 😎,0
I didn't even realize this video is almost 40 mins long 🤯 Enjoyed every second of it! 😎👌🏻,157
"The quality of your video is insane, I can practically see each individual hair on your head. The cameras you’re using to capture your content are outstanding!!",111
5:22 You can actually turn it off just by holding both buttons for 5 seconds and there will be a power off slider.,0
Just stumbled on your review and channel. My only comment/perspective (slight at best): This is like FPV to me as when you are placing your body into the imaginary cockpit of a drone you are augmenting your reality. I wonder if that learning curve is lessened?,0
"This is such a good video, feels like I understand the Vision Pro so much better now",64
"With the eye tracking, advertisers are going to love this! Imagine being able to ""see"" who is looking directly at your obnoxious ad on a website? That is a game changer",103
They are the game changers!!!!,0
On my wish list is an Apple Vision Pro,0
"14:98  ""Pretty quick if its a URL you can say out loud"" Homie knows what urls we be looking up",175
This is an amazing review and excellent quality video. The camera man smiling in the background gave me life!,54
Make sense 10 years time this will be alot smaller and smarter thank God for  tech,0
"Her,
I would like to point out that the power cable can be removed from the battery pack.
Just need to use a pin in the hole and pull the wire out. 
similer to sim card eject",0
"Apple had the ability to give us amazing battery life, since the battery isn't in the headset, and they chose not to. In true Apple fashion.",309
we’re getting closer to ready player one every day…,125
"I think I've only seen one video on this that talks about wearing this thing for extended time with the default strap is uncomfortable.  Apple included a regular strap, that goes around and over the head, to take the weight pressing on your face and supporting it with the strap over your head.  No one shows it or mentions it.",0
So you could actually do gaming from the macbook pro? It surprised me that Marques didnt try it,0
34:48 *they could fix the hair problem by providing a “bald” cover for the person when setting it up and then just adding a virtual customizable hairstyle with nice physics and texture*,81

"when we have Vison Pro 5, ill get a vision pro 3.",0
"Probably a very silly question but.....What about people with glasses? Do you wear this thing without your glasses on, and if so does the device adjust for the lack of vision? Or is this product exclusively for those with perfect vision already?",0
"In five days 20 000 000 views and it is insane! Because your content is incredible, the unboxing well detailed...thanks for your content! Definitely my time wasn't wasted",61
"When i was a kid that was actually what i imagined the future to be, wearing some glasses and and watching some movies and no one knows what your watching, it insane that were already at this level",167

You know I know you know I know you know what's up.

Edit: fixed typos",174
i hope it´ll be achievable for everyone in the future,0
very very well explained. great job dude!,0
One of the best tech product explainer video I have ever seen. Well done Marques... 👌,34
This thing can do so much for people who are disabled or bedridden who can't get out of their house or room for long periods of time. Imagine being able to bring the world to you in 3D in such an elegant manner.,87
"The future is limitless, I can already imagine multiple person working together on a 3d model of a car or a house design",0
"Lol, Remember the ""FaceHugger is an iPhone"" meme from a few years ago... look's like Apple said ""That's the Goal Boys!""",0
“If it’s a URL you can say out-loud” 😂😂😂,30
Marques sticks out his tongue at 29:30 LMAO,27
You can turn it off by holding the button and crown down for about 5 seconds.  Then a power off indicator will show up like on an iphone.,1
Imagine gaming with this. Using the controller ofcourse,2
Much better than the verge’s review. It’s fun watching tech reviewers actually get excited about tech.,54
Well done as always MKBHD. Loved your point on tech being fun again. That sentiment is captured in this piece.,24
I looked up the price on the Apple vision pro and the price I seen was $3499. I sure hope the price drops to a more affordable number. For the average person $3500 is just to high of a price for the average consumer to afford. That being said the Apple vision pro does look very impressive.,0
"Actually the headset can be turned off. 
Press and hold the crown and the top button simultaneously for about 4seconds while wearing the headset and the option to switch off will appear. 
You can also shut it down through the general tab in settings.
Thank me later.",1
Using a proprietary cable was a nice touch after that awesome price.,100
literally just finished watching the unboxing. great content!,64
people calling it odd to wear in conversation but its just the start to where it will be,0
"> ""They want you to default to putting the battery in your back pocket""
> Puts the battery in his front pocket, fits perfectly

Please respect the person at Apple who's spent the last three years researching back pockets",0
You’re really stepping it up with this series Marques… awesome work…,22
"The whole world is so glued to the screen and like this wasn't enough, now we have this",50
I can imagine that for those who suffer from paralysis of the body in some way this would be so freeing for them,0
This is much better then the phone screen being smashed in your face to use it as VR,0

9 days old video and already your second most popular video ever. Crazy and well done Marques 👍,59
Superb work as always!,409
Did i miss the part about if you need to use it with the lights on or not .,0
Burglars no longer need to wait  till you leave home 😂,0
"Probably the Apple vision pro will be the most advanced vr headset from a technical point of view (with a very sharp passthrough, an OLED screen and so on) and this is fine that it is emphasized in a review. What surprises me is that many journalists in the industry, who I assume have also tried other headsets like the Meta quest Pro or the Meta quest 3, do not point out that many of these features have been present for a long time on the Meta headsets, while it seems that they have discovered them only now with the Apple headset.",29
"""if it's a url that you can actually say out loud"" 🤣 @15:03",36
Needs mouse n keyboard accessory to use faster or gaming controller,0
"Yeah, I'm interested but not an Apple fan at all. It's rumored that Huawei are considering making something similar, I'll wait for that since it will probably be cheaper and better (Especially since they're probability analyzing all the current vision pro flaws)",0
One of the best product review videos ive ever seen. Very informative,49
2:07 Perfect dust collector <3,23
"I really hope this goes the ""supersonic flight"" way.",0
"i like the fact the is saying ""apple vision pro and it turns the video in 114p lol",0
I feel like it should have a rear view camera.. perhaps in the middle of the head strap. just something that could be on display in the corner as you walk.,197
"I think the reason why there’s no fun overlay of the apple maps app like Marques was asking at 19:32 is because Apple specifically said you should only use the Vr headset in safe places and maybe don’t want you trying to walk around wearing it to avoid unfortunate incidents, great detailed video as always Marques.",33
"I really thought the tv stand was the most confused by mac people I'd ever get, but no... once again, yall fuckin blow my mind.",0
review a perc 30 next,0
18:35 I could hear the GOOD MORNING miles away 😂😂,63
Your reviews are actually next level. You made me feel like i was using it. Complete awe factor,86
"That Facetime demo looked really cool!  But it's disturbing how the personas ""eat"" your ears.  The hair is kinda bad, but the missing ears throws it straight into uncanny valley for me.",0
"omg, this is a solution in search of a problem that doesn't exist. So many people will eat this up without even questioning...",1
I love how Apple insists Apple Vision Pro is a completely different product from all of the other VR headsets to the absurd degree of claiming it's not actually a VR Headset at all,103
"I suffer from retinitis pigmentosa, a rare eye disease that impacts the night and peripheral vision. The Vision Pro is going to be a life changer!!! Especially when it gets smaller, I can easily see myself wearing it in dark environments and use the oass through camera to see things.",118
"The thing is that developers purchase two three big size screens for thier work and with this device they can have unlimited screens. 

Crazy stuff

First time I am impressed with apple for thier genuine justified price product.

Its next level thing. The only concern is the weight of this device. 

As it is first gen may be this device will come down to a mere size normal sunglasses than it would b definitely much cooler and futuristic than ever.


And it will definitely open markets for big innovators like samsung to compete with apple. And will se the bulky thing getting pinched to a normal eyewear size.


6-7 years This will be a big thing.....",1
Nice  futuristic options in it but not 4K nice.,0
Crazy tech. Cant wait to see how this evolves,116
Great review. And what a time to be alive. But I think a couple of updates later the vision pro would start making at least some noise while trying to cool down the system.,652
"IMHO we should really move away from mAh as a measure of battery capacity because 2 packs with the same mAh rating can wind up with 2-3 fold more or less energy in them depending on voltage. I've already seen this cause confusion eg with an Anker battery I bought that has bad reviews for being 5Ah instead of the advertised 10Ah, which is technically true because it uses 2 5Ah cells in series instead of parallel. It has the same energy content as a traditional 10Ah battery but it's technically not 10Ah.",0
Imagine doing sport by playing FPS games . that will be so crazy !,1
The FaceTime persona call looks like you are dreaming it lmao,31
Marques never disappoints bro ong,66
"I am wondering .. like I saw in an ad, people wearing shuch headset are walking on road and pinching doing their stuff simultaneously. If for some reason, the camera feed screen fails to refresh, and the person doesn't catch this immediately. And if he was crossing road in hurry, a vehicle which is still away as per the headset, would crash with him in realtime.",0
"Just apple cementing their domination of technology, its awesome",0
"Can't wait to come back to this video 5 years later and see how advanced the Vision Pro 3 Max Ultra is with the $9999 price tag 😂 Seriously, this is one of the best tech reviews ever! 👏",22
"It wasn't until I got 33:00 minutes into this that I started to get excited - this ability to direct attention to individuals is a really important capability, especially for those of us who work remotely but manage teams. What a great review.",63
"One important question, we may wonder!   How many hours of Vision Pro we can use,  until we used up our eyes.   
Simple down to, what wave of light, is going into user's eyes",0
Idiocracy was not kidding about Frito's on the future!!,1
35:16 totally useful.. doing meetings w hair messy and no makeup but still looking glamorous virtually. lol 😂,46
He is the only person who actually explain each and every detail of things that no one else tell. It actually make you think weather you need this product or not😍,23
Wonder if he felt any nausea while using it?  Any VR headset so far I've used I felt nausea after only 15 min use that last for hours after removing it off my face.,0

"This is like cyberpunk edgerunner where they just pickup calls and messages in their eyes so there’s no need for phones anymore, you could also change your fov in real life now lol",0
"It looks just like any of these Chinese AR glasses, but with somewhat better controls",0
Give this guy a raise!  This was the review I was looking for... great job. I want one just for traveling. Imagine being on a plane and using this!,24
That Mac integration is insanely cool. Possibly the coolest part of this whole thing.,52
it has a removable cable... You can remove it using a sim ejector tool,0

“A url you can say out loud” ahahahahaha amazing,37
You'd think differently about the glass and metal after watching Jerry rigs everything,0
Advanced Tech IS Magic.,0
"Fascinating stuff. Especially since Apple has chosen to go the productivity route with this. Like, we spent an entire video talking about one of the most advanced VR headsets ever made, and gaming on it wasn't even discussed.",28
You have a real knack for explaining things. This was a great and very honest review.,33
does it work with glasses? what about eye lense?,0
"Wait for the 2nd gen to be released, it’s gonna have more features,like receiving phone calls, also Netflix and YouTube apps , the price gonna decrease about a quarter I believe .",0
"This actually feels like a real review, rather than one of those excitement hype reviews sponsored by the manufacturer.  I got so aggravated this week by the initial reviews of the Lexus GX 550 vs the older GX460 (and 4Runner) because it to me it was very obvious that based on all the footage, the truck overall appears to be cheaper and lower-luxury than the outgoing GX460.  But perhaps in fear of NOT getting invited to future press day events, just about every reviewer wasn't really directly addressing that topic.  They were just like, it's got more power, it's got seats that feel better, here are the trim lines if you want real-leather and rear-heated seats...and on, and it felt like ""leading the witness"" to get you to buy into what they were saying.  The talking points likely were provided or suggested by Lexus/Toyota.  And they didn't want to mention whether they were or were not allowed to open-report on the new truck either.  
At least this was a pretty objective, preliminary hardware review of Vision Pro, so thank you Marques!",65
No one will ever know what this comment was and the Truth to the Universe.,334
Can u please do PlayStation vr2  vs apple vision pro,0
Look at this distinguished gentleman look at the way he is sitting yes 🦁,0
Excellent review. Thank you for taking the time to do it.,30
I have absolutely no practical reason to own one but it looks incredible. The future of this product will be amazing,39
"Maybe typing on your phone as input could do better, you just have to pair it with your phone and use it as a keyboard for the time.

Our hands are free after all🙂
And we are more used to typing on the phone",0
"26:42 I feel like nobody's talking about the fact that the displayed eyes also sit higher on your face than in reality (at certain angles, like 26:33, they even look like they're on your forehead; in general, though, they look 1-3 cm higher at all times), adding to the uncanny-valley feeling.  I'm interested why Apple didn't want to make them appear lower (more lifelike).",0
The thought of seeing people constantly tapping their fingers together already sounds hilarious 🤣,141
You know is going to be cool when Marquees says “I’ve been using for a week now” haha just love it.,49

"Nice video, as a noob I just dont see a use case for this longterm. Gaming on a 500 usd Quest 3 with some good titles to go with it, great hobby. But spending 3,5k usd on this without any great apps/ games at launch? What does watching a Youtube video on an augmented moon give me more than my PC setup? Apple products usually aint a good investment but this sounds like a very expensive niche product to me. Then theres all the practical limitations of having a headset on when the task could very well be done with a normal screen setup much more comfortable...",0
"This seems like a really good starting point. It’s super polished and very powerful. It’s just really empty right now. MKBHD idea of having arrows on the ground for Google maps for example should be a must. I’ll be skipping gen 1 and looking forward for gen2 or 3 when there’s more reason for one. 

Also I know gaming isn’t the focus. But defiantly missing out on at least making it a possible pc wireless link alternative. Hopefully one of the next gen’s will get some vr game support and optional remotes",24
Its exciting to imagine what the evolution of this device might be,37
This is cool and also absolutely scary!,0
you have nice video and I like the way you review but your videos have way too many ads,0
"You can see that there's still so much room for improvement, which is actually an exciting thing. I remember over a decade ago when people had all these creative concepts for how to improve the iPhone/smartphone experience, and eventually all of the most popular concepts became reality once these devices had the processing power to handle it. It'll be nice seeing that same energy devoted to improving a new medium that can see really big changes with each generation, while smartphones are at the stage where they just bump up the processor 20%, make the camera a little clearer, make the screen a little brighter, add some AI gimmick and call it a new generation.",52
"This is the type of VR that my generation ""born in the 80s"" has been waiting for. VR for us is like flying cars for the 50s generation.

"Interesting that The Verge's review complained about the real-world passthrough being short on colors (the displays do less than 50% of the colors the human eye can see), and Marques is like ""The colors are great!"" ...while sitting in an almost entirely white/gray office space :D",22

VR/AR headsets are exactly where they were about ten years ago: cool gimmicks that’ll just collect dust after the first month or so of usage.

The only way VR/AR picks up is if they manage to shrink it to a smaller form factor with all day battery life. The former, Google already tried with Google Glasses and were partly successful but with the battery technology storage today, no way it’s gonna be possible to store all day battery life in a package that small. 

And above all, charging absurd amounts, upwards of 3000 dollars is gonna steer people away all the more, it’ll be nothing more than a shiny toy.",0

"There's a lot to like and there's a lot to hate. The number one thing I like about it is that there's going to be a lot of creative professionals with really expensive software, multitasking with these things and providing feedback to software developers which is going to lead to some efficient leaps and bounds that we haven't been able to see in the more gaming centric headsets preceding Apple's contribution to the field.
The outward-facing OLED in my opinion is kind of wasteful but who am I to say what rich people should do with their money and I suppose there's some gotta be some kind of reasonable use outside of cosmetic use... ?
But yeah, it wastes money, and what is already a miniscule battery.
I hate the proprietary plug that's really stupid for consumers, the external battery pack leaving the headset completely front focused shows that they've got a long way to go and they're rather tone deaf regarding actual long-term use of a VR headset. The lack of 3D virtualized environmental offerings beyond what is likely to be an excellent pass through and otherwise augmented reality experience is off-putting, but it's good to see that despite the closed ecosystem there are people out there making these things work and additionally I figure eventually it will be a priority to actually provide interesting software and services supporting their platform. I do think there's a certain element of anti-competitive practices that are keeping a lot of software from being supported on the Apple platform but I'm not surprised by that as they're late to the game and capitalizing like they normally do.
in the end additionally the exorbitant cost of this thing isn't really something that should be surprising considering this is definitely an early adopter thing and as such while it has a lot of good features these are basically the stock standard features that everyone expects in virtual at this time but again with a price point that is 3 - 8 times more than it's nearest competitors depending on where you place this in the market. The trick to that is is it's not really in an external market and that's the strength that it brings to the external market oddly enough. The fact is the strongest thing about this headset is that it's going to bring people from within the apple microculture and introduce them to something they've stayed mostly ignorant about and and it's going to bring a lot of enthusiasm and innovation into the future of entertainment and what is essentially the evolution of the cell phone and micro computer.
I only wish they had gone with a transparent setup with a an electronic array of localized dimmers or glass that can be made opaque in zones so the passthrough and display elements could work in tandem and allowing an overlay on things you can actually see through the displays rather than relying only on cameras and lidar for producing passthrough. That it's not a full XR experience is a bummer, but the more these megacorp entities invest in the tech, and the more they saddle the losses for the sake of the longevity of the innovations, the better it will be for us, so I'm all for it, at least in the context of advancing the technology.
So, were not really even close to Being there with this headset, but at least it's opening more eyes to the reality of virtual reality, and how beneficial it can be for many.",0
"It's a pity that it has to be labeled as a 'spatial computer' instead of being recognized as Apple's AR/VR device with controllers. I would prefer Apple to compete with Quest 3, leveraging the power of the M2 chip, micro-OLED screens, and their superior tracking quality. This could enable games like Resident Evil Village to reach PS5 quality on a wireless device.",0

"What people are forgetting is that a healthy person's peripheral vision is 180 degrees, and Apple Vision Pro gives you 110. So when you fool yourself that you have a big screen in front of you, that feeling is compared to your newly adapted peripheral vision, which is actually pretty small compared to your actual peripheral vision. So Apple users, do not kid yourselves with those measurements. I saw a reviewer saying he does not need a bigger screen in front of him because he is forced to look right and left. 😅 And he forgets the fact that it is the lack of that device's capability, not yours. 😂 So please stop comparing Apple Vision's monitor illusions to an actual super ultrawide monitor that fills your entire actual peripheral vision.",0

"Let's get real, these devices are created by geeks for geeks based on what looks cool etc..not based on solid marketing or usability. The makers and designers live in a bubble of their own unable perceive the usability of their creations outside their perceived reality. Sure, it's a device good for some things like gaming and multimedia. However, all the physical gestures required will literally get tiresome after a while. Not to mention the physical discomfort that results in wearing it more than 45min or so. Imagine putting that on a hot humid day! As I type this on my oversized smartphone, which I have been using 50min or so, the finger tips on the hand holding my phone are almost numb while my elbow is sore from resting on my desk. My point is.. this is a gimmick that will have niche adopters and not for the general public. Specially with that price point.",1
AUGMENTED REALITY?,0
I really wouldn't call it high end.. The fact that the battery pack is external and it being non-removable just shows how desperate they are to force people to spend money on their proprietary trash! Secondly is the lack of controllers. We all know Apple isn't really made for gaming but at that price point you'd expect it to run games and come with controllers. The Quest 3 is way more versatile and just a fraction of the cost!,0
What a dumb idea. Hey are all of you going snorkeling later!,0
"No Youtube, No Netflix, No Spotify, bad comfort and short battery life. Yeah that's a instant no no. I was never an apple fan, so I'll never spend on something like that. Just better buy a PC with that amount of money lol.",0
"If any other company released a product like this, it would flop. the only reason it has anyone looking at it as a serious item is because it's apple.. Solid pass-through seems to be the only new technology the headset has brought to the VR world and even then, meta is close enough in their headsets pass through that it doesn't really justify spending 3-4k. Other headsets have high pixel density, other headsets have eye and face tracking, other headsets have hand tracking with the exact same touch based interface, and what's worse, projecting the screen in the headset was one of the earliest features VR headsets had... Based off everything you've mentioned here, there's no real reason to spend money on the vision pro, it's just not that useful for anything that other VR headsets already have, and have done better. 

One could argue that seamless integration with photos and other things on your devices is cool. Sure, but is it 4k dollars cool?",0
"Can you connect it to a pc to play video games? If not, ite mostly useless for now
Most of the development for VR has only been done in gaming

Would really appreciate your help. Thanks in advance 🙏",0
This is the sort of tech that will be incredibly laughable in retrospect a few years from now (the way we now laugh at the old brick cellphones).,0
"It's really cool, but I don't really see a reason to spend $4,000 dollars on it.",0
"Let's be honest, these are gonna be used to watch porn and binge TikToks. Apple and other companies will use these to further track your every single move and behaviors and you will no longer even own your thoughts. 
You will loose that last part of your humanity and further disconnect you from the actual world until you have no relation to it. 

The tech on display here is awesome for sure, but it will be used for sinister and predatory purposes and we will see suicide rates and depression on a scale we have yet to even fathom if these are to replace our phones. 
Don't buy into your own doom. Slow things down in your life, be more assertive with your time and actions. Stay in reality for a while and you will be better off for it.",0
:(,0
No decent apps nah,0
I'll pass... Thanks...,0
Again way to come into the game late Apple and act like you invented it.,0
How to turn a person into a zombie.,0
"being around Bluetooth , radiation to the eyes and brain",0
Vr is such an overhyped scam,0
"Please buddy stop using it. Areas covered by it not getting sunlight. Specially dont use it outside under direct sunlight or in nice summer trip. 
Soon everyones face is going to turn into something similar after removing bikini 😁🤣😁",0

Is this not going to make people lose their eye sight faster? We humans are so delicate. Something horrible is going to come from this.,0
😅😢😢😢😢f,0
"reminds me of film ""Surrogates"" its comming to that ;D for ex others will see you like real hot men or women and you ll see them as furries , that will ruin the wold for sure, not Putin :D",0
I think this is the most depressing video EVER lol,0
"It's still fascinating and both baffling at the same time how people blindly pine for such atrociously overpriced and recycled technology that has existed 10 years prior, and then inhale this copium of ""it's actually pretty good!"" when it's literally impractical to both use and buy.

Sheep will be sheep I guess! But this time, said sheep will be looking like they're about to go skiing!",0
It’s not impressive.. he’s trying so hard 😂😂,1
"1year later 500,000,000$ lawsuit due to Blindness cause by wearing Apple vision pro 20hours a day",0
ecosystem is a downside when it comes to apple not a plus,0
Here is a crazy idea. Take the money you woukd spend on that and do something in the real world. Smh,0
I feel like anyone with over a million subscribers should only ever show up as a persona in any media. This goes for influencers and dulm actors who've grossed over a million dollars.,0
I hope this is not future,1
Cool another thing we don’t fucking need!!,0
Pin please!,0
When will you stop apple simping bro.,0
I really just don’t get this. Who really needs this?,0
People really have no life. Leave all those craps and go enjoy real life and some sun outside. You'll be happier 😂,1
Can you send me vision pro gift me,0
This can't be good for your eyes.,0
"From this to Quest.....nothing's that impressive. 
And this thing is definitely not 2/3+ thousand more impressive.......absolutely not.",0
Help me get one PLEASE IF YOU SEE THIS,0
"I could have 10 million, I’ll still wait for China to make something better and 4x cheaper",0
There is no way I'm the only one that thinks this is a rip off. 🤣🤣.  No YouTube no Netflix. Android should definitely retaliate.,0
i would much more prefer a oculus quest pro over this,0
"wow, this design is so dumb. you already got a cable, so how about instead of plugging it into a batterypack, you plug it into an outlet.",0
This is a lot of tech to do basically nothing important.,0
I feel old watching this. It looks so pointless,1
Like if you want Tony Stark to be the next CEO of Apple.,0
Nah I wanna pass,1
Nerd Googles,0
I have no use for this. So i'll pass.,0
Only Apple can convince people to look this stupid.,2
This thing is so weird.,0
Who would need this?,0
Pointless especially for the price.,0
feels like the chinese government would really love to have this normalized,0
good bye biometric data and unique retina scans. hello social control china!,0
"I dont really get the use for it, seems like overpriced gimmicky software for a VR.  Id way rather use my mouse and keyboard then fingers to pinch stuff and wave my hand around.",0
Can't wait to hear about all the new cases of brain cancer that people have no idea why is happening 😅.,0
I eat chicken,0
Totally omissed any mention of gaming. dislike,1
This item looks impressive and completely pointless,0
30:45 Least racist apple product lol,0
Underwhelming,0
Nintendo did it first,0
"This is a device that marks the new era of digital slavery and the final stage of human existence at the end times. People are getting dumbed down, are getting lost in meaningless and false visual environments while separating themselves even from their own family members and it is as frightening as it gets. I’m going back to my old Nokia dumb phone and notepad. I had enough.",0
Bloody ridiculous,0
It’s cool and all and interesting. But let’s be real. If this catches on it’ll be a nightmare for humanity as a whole for many reasons. I will never buy one of these.,0
meh,0
Wow that typing is horseshit. I would have atleast imagined it integrated with the $1500 iPhone in everyone’s pocket and can atleast utilize the iPhone as a controller or keyboard.,0
It’s a fake one,0
The gadget is not as superb as  Your presentation. The output that we see through the gadget is all like AI generated content and does not look real and virtual specifically while doing face time.,0
who the F would like to walk around looking like that...  i will laugh high and point if i see tragic people walk around like that... ha ha ha ha ha ha,0
Stupid thing to spend money on😂,0
"This is weird, and as pointless as the google glasses",0
😂🤮🤮🤮,0
This is the dumbest tech I've seen in awhile lol,0
"This device is 100% not worth it, and if you buy the first generation of anything you might be a moron. The fact that I have to carry around an external battery pack to power this headset is absolutely stupid the second thing is people are complaining about eye strain. how the F are we not at 240 Hz in all of our devices that would reduce eye fatigue and strain like crazy. Simply put the technology just is not here yet and Apple is trying to push something that they have not mastered yet this device is 100% a waste of money",0
im so glad these are actually terrible and nobody will use them.,0
Useless,0
Vision pro🤡🏳️‍🌈😂,1
the more you are immersed in your bullshit gadgets the less you are going to see the primitive spears coming at you,0
"Total nonsense, It is still an expensive potato.",0
This thing is dumb. And dangerous,0
"a useless expensive toy, Apple have already failed... and Google Glass, remember)))?",0
Worst product Apple has put out. Might have a lot of applications within the work environment but otherwise it's a straight no.  Horrible device.,0
u use android...shame on u :),0
"does it improve the hentai viewing experience? thats the only thing we subscribers care about, everything else that thing does is useless",0
This comment won't get 12.5 Likes!,2
the apple vision pro is sad and stupid,0
crap tech,0
too bad apple sucks,0
This product should be banned,0
Gay!,1
The dumbest and most useless thing Apple has produced so far (you can tell that Steve Job's genius is fading out regrettably) and its horribly expensive too. There are more performant and less heavy VR devices out there.,0
What stupid device,1
no thx horrible thing,0
