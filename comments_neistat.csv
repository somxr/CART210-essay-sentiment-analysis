Happy to help film this one! Please don’t ever FaceTime me with your Persona again thanks,21590
"2:43 ""I get off here... Enjoy your adventure!"" was so genuine and sweet.",15972
When you feel like Times Square doesn't have enough screens already,47
"there is a deep and uncomfortable disconnect in what is about to happen. 
simply because we are going to let it happen...
it doesn't end well.",37
I am deaf... I would love something like this to actively make captions for everyone around me so I can tell what people are saying... would be amazing.,3474
"This is the type of review I'm so glad exists 😅

2:05 There's a travel mode in the control settings! Apple says it's made for airplanes but... I suspect it'll do pretty good on subway too",13108
"But... honestly, why is it good that our ""outside"" reality will be bombarded with access to our online worlds? If it's hard enough now to sit in a room with friends and stay focused on ""the now"" and enjoy the moments together, are you insinuating that our future is basically that no moments together will be unencumbered by apps, videos, calls, and augmented reality? Why is that good?",31
This genuinely terrifies me for what’s to come in the next few decades,69
I wanna watch this again in 10-20 years. This gonna be like watching people with their first bulky mobile phones,2398
The cut away of you holding the donut up killed me. LOL.,3016
This will be a great boost for people alienation,6
"thansk for the video, really enjoyed this type of reveiw.",1
That man on the subway with the beautiful blue tie was very sweet “enjoy your adventure” ☺️ 2:29,626
"This is a fun video to watch!

I used it as inspiration for creating a short story about the apple vision pros",0
Casey using iphone se 1st generation makes me happy because i still use mine!! Best phone,5
This was one of my favorite Black Mirror episodes!,799
"What stood out to me is how friendly everyone was. ""Enjoy your adventure"" How amazing is that guy!",1149
"Casey, you are a gem. What a great video, and thanks for saying what I've been thinking.",0
First time watching your channel. I really appreciate the info but what I really loved about this was that - especially at the end when you were giving us your thoughts - you didn't put micro editing cuts after every six words like most Youtubers do today. It was very mature and professional. Thank you.,29
"That gentleman at 2:30 is security for my office building. He’s an amazing guy, what a treat to see him on here",762
"Let me tell you one thing, THIS is the best review that I ever seen about this product. It is a real review in real life. Congratulations and I hope Apple engineers take notes about this video.",827
You always do such a good job,0
Good video bro. Its pretty down to earth while getting others input. I like that.,0
What an incredible way of showing this product off. Not something that you'd see a typical review do. I appreciate your authenticity.,454
This video is going to be so legendary in 10 years,1020
In 30 years when we have this tech in contact lenses this video is going to be a classic. Like the first experience with atari footage,198
"finally, the review we all needed.",1
The butterfly moment killed me 🤣 🦋,8881
"Bro this is why you’re one of the OGs
Because you don’t repeat the same review that every YouTuber does - unbox the device etc - you entertain us through film while teaching us about it. This is a true review!",769
8:57 yeah man this is def a good thing,2
I gotta say this makes me both nervous and excited. I wonder when it gets super clean will by workflow be better more efficient so when I am connected I can multitask better or not be sitting all day. Then when I want to turn it off and be in the real world I can do that too. I already see it now. Real life is something people are actively seeking out. I miss sometimes not being able to “disconnect” the way we used to when we had landlines only. But now that time has passed with computers in our pockets we’re starting to figure out how to give ourselves what we need as humans even whilst we engage fully in the tech. I think we’ll be alright but there will be a learning curve.,0
"""Enjoy your adventure"" 

What a guy. So peaceful and kind. Everyone else feels that, right?",1304
"2:44 I like how when the guy on the train said ""enjoy your adventure,"" a title called Adventure appeared in the apple tv app right after.",390
"u r a good creator man, keep making more videos, thanks🙂",0
Great review thanks man,0
People just staring at you while you say “the butterfly is eating my donut” had me dying 🤣🤣,715
"i feel like New York is like the perfect place to test this. most people will be completely uninterested in whatever you have going on, and the ones who do care will be cool enough characters to include in a video. its like the perfect choice",426
Another visual masterpiece.,0
"I can imagine having one in the day to day life, growing up with one, and revisiting ur home town. Where every day to day moment long forgotten is qued up to view, a video you left running at the bus stop, a map for getting from your house to a once new cofee shop. Instagram posts shwoing up as forgotten memories not based on time of year, but location as you hit each archived benchmark. Pulling up videos of you and your friends, friends you may not have talked to in years, all comes flooding back not just in your mind, but with the media and documentation of those forgotten memories. Ar overlays of new buildings shwoing the floor planes and store fronts of what used to be on that block, a glimpse of the world not just how it is, but how it is remembered.",18
The men in the metro was so kind and respectful.,419
Im fine with the present. Being always connected looks like the best way of being always alone. Boredom is an important human experience and having this will just make us consume content non stop,766
That was a dope Marques plug and shout out,1
Anyone noticed Thansk ? 😂 His review is so authentic. He shows the practical use case of vision pro that no one has shown in any other video. Great 👌,1
"The man who said ""enjoy your adventure"" was so wholesome 2:45",1132
Videos like this are a good reminder of why I love Casey’s videos and story telling ability. Glad he pops up every now and then.,332
About time you  ought up! Can do that with the quest as well.,0
they really need speech to text on this so you're not stopping to type awkwardly.  it's something I've discussed while in one of my classes recently. where we brought up accessibility and when people have issue's with their hands or no hands at all. I think i see a option there maybee? to the far right at the bottom? 3:58 if you pause it but I honestly think it should be better explained or more readily available to those who need it.,0
3:40 imagine taking the subway in one or two years and having to dodge all the zombies who parked in front of you to text  😭😭😭,256
The bizareness of Casey typing on the stairs at 3:45 in the air from the outside perspectice. It just kills me everytime 😂😂,398
Been waiting for a clip from you,0
Cool concept. To many glitch things i was picking up on. I still need to know about trading apps etc.  Others i read said they thought it was cool first week or so then ....,0
"As a tech geek, this is super cool... 

As a human that feel like my phone makes me disconnected from reality... this makes me feel like we are going to get even more disconnected from reality/the present and more connected to the digital world. 

If thats good or bad is up to each and everyone to decide for themselves.",665
"That outside perspective of Casey waving a donut around in the air just going ""The butterflies are eating my donut"" was hilarious 😂",212
Best review/experience out,0
"I agree that this is the future of computing, but also agree that the tech needs to get smaller, lighter, and cheaper, almost like regular sunglasses, just like you said! The day this happens, 🎉",2
“Apple Vision Pro kids” about to replace “iPad kids”??,9041
I’m a simple man. I see a video by this guy and I’m back in 2016 at 20 years old dreaming of an electric longboard… dude the nostalgia you evoked with this…. Thank you. I missed you. Crap I’m crying now.,404
dude @ 2:19 trying to be _sneaky recording Casey_ LMFAOOOOOOOO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,1
"Thanks ,i have one and want to travel right now",0
I already think we're on our phones ignoring the people around us too much. This is just dystopian AF 😂,435
"Haha loved the synchronicity of the guy saying ""enjoy your adventure"" and right after you open Netflix to ""Adventure"". The guy was a wizard 😂",303
It was dope seeing yu at the Sony Creative awhile back…,0
"The most interesting point for me that it is already so good that you get really into it in a so short time…
When I get it right you get the vision, set it up and directly after that you done this video, so just one day and you got already the true feeling of AR…
That’s just amazing cuz that is just exactly what AR should be, the integration from the digital into the real world, that is just the barebone idea of AR and Apple seems to nailed it…
Just impressive…",1
"This is the most original review of the Apple Vision Pro. Everyone is reviewing them in controlled environment, this review was original and provided a totally different perspective on this new emerging technology outside of an office or living room. Nice one!",182
This is hysterical. I laughed so hard at you just standing on the steps poking at thin air 🤣🤣,820
"What a human being u are, the ultimate best",0
"“I get off here, enjoy your adventure!” 😢 im not crying you are😢",269
broooooo the typing at 3:50 killed me 😂,371
"I thought your intro was gonna be you whiting them out like your sunglasses
Would be Iconic",0
"You have to use travel mode if your are moving, otherwise it won't correct for that motion. other than that you could hold on to the window while youre moving",0
"I didn't laugh this much in a long time 🤣 The texting on the steps, the butterfly....",316
"The idea of everyone having some type of device like the Vision Pro in the future is disconcerting. That moment when you’re in Time Square is what stood out to me. There are tons of people around and you’re in an isolated world within the headset. People already interact less with the people around them because of cellphones, and I can only see this getting worse if we’re able to set up an entire office wherever we are. The future looks lonely if this is where we’re headed.",245
I think I'll wait for them to advance the tech but I'm glad it's a success because it means more companies will make more improved versions,0
Y'all did an amazing job at filming the video as if Casey was still filming himself. The style still very much looks like a vlog.,0
"These things make us engage in ultimate dopamine, we're going to become so dependant on these type of things to feel satisfied, and whenever we're not using it, we're going to crave it, that's why it's important to think it through. Acknowledge your surrounding and be aware of what you're doing, meditation is key to not get consumed by the machines.",519
This is the best critique of this experience without actually critiquing it directly with words.,262
"After waiting a week to try it, my husband finally did yesterday (our kid has one). After spending just a few minutes on it, watching the beginning of a movie, he retired to his office to watch something on his t.v. and said, 'well, I'll never be happy just watching anything on a t.v. now.' The first thing I wanted to try (other than the immersive environments which are AMAZING) was to watch a movie on a huge screen. I didn't realize there were theater environments (Disney's is great) and the experience was beyond my wildest imagination. You are seriously IN a theater; there are even 'cupholders' next to you, and floorlights in the 'aisles.' I watched Coco in 3D and, having seen it before on a television, it was a completely different experience and my reaction to it was different. I was more emotionally invested in the story. No distractions. I literally cried (and wondered if I was damaging the vision pro lol). 

But I also opened a book on the device and started reading. I have ADHD and it is rarely easy to focus on a book, but with the pages in front of you and an environment surrounding it to block out distractions, it is much easier to focus on the words and to stay engaged. I can see this helping people with attention issues -- and so much more. Like Casey said, this is the future of computing and interacting with media. It is a truly unique and incredible experience.",42
"A decent review- do they feel like first gen gear? Clunky, slow software?",0
"""enjoy your adventure"" what a nice guy. we need more like him.",72
"5:38 ""it's impossible for me to imagine that you can't see what I can see"" -  that quote right there highlights the awesomeness of this thing. it feels like the 90s all over again where we see this cool new thing and then imagine all the potential.",593
"Wow, of all the review videos I've seen no one has played video. I wanted to find out how video looks like in this. Giid work.",0
"hey, i know this may be a long shot but i am attending stn this year, where i know you will be speaking and was wondering if i’d be able to convince you to help do the morning anchoring for my school at the convention, we could record right before/after your speech! lmk!",0
Master Toyota Technician. A while back they said AR would help a technician work on a vehicle. This would be such a game changer in an industrial setting. When I'm working on an electronic diag I can have my wiring diagram while I work. It would be even crazier if it can illuminate with IR or have a thermo camera to show heat resistance in a wire. This is a game changer. Can't wait for the future.!,187
9:36 he perfectly described future computing in one sentence and a gesture,282
"Sure - I believe you. This may be the future. 

Careful what you wish for.",0
this was so good,0
"I love how Casey showcases the absurdity of this thing, while still being amazed by it.",162
This is by far the best non-review review of this thing. Casey is such an incredible storyteller,366
"what about safety concerns not being able to see corner of your eye or  anything that can impair your vision, did you feel safe?",0
"I've seen a few videos involving these goggles. The main thing I notice that concerns me is the lack of situational awareness the users have. People stopping in cross walks, people stopping on stairs, etcetera.",104
In control center there’s a travel mode which makes it so you can use it in moving vehicles,80
The reaction of people is the best part!,0
casey always has another view on stuff.. thats why i love watching his videos.. thx man for being on youtube !!!,3
"""I get off here ... Enjoy your adventure"" The line was priceless...!! Great non review Mr Neistat, I always love your content..!!",195
"Also, you stopped on the stairwell typing, was gold. I laughed out loud.",409
"Really cool technology with great potential - I saw MS HoloLens years ago - amazing.
BUT, no peripheral vision - really bad idea around the streets - ok at home etc...
It's already bad enough with peeps with headphones - there's so many that have been hit or had near misses with cars/bikes/other pedestrians (I've had several walk almost out in front of me).",0
A great review.,0
It was so funny to watch people stare in pure confusion as he tries to feed his donut to the virtual dinosaur 😂,1952
I love how the family just stares at him @ 6:30. XD,392
"I wish I can experience that thing, or get owned to experience 😁 I love futuristic technology such like that..",0
I love this. AVP vs NYC. Round 1 *ding* *ding*,0
You can always count on Casey to review the Vision Pro in the most _New York_ way possible!  😄,220
Master story teller at work. I was grinning ear to ear throughout the whole video. It is so refreshing to see someone bring a human emotional perspective to a tech review. Thank you Casey. I am grateful I live in the same world as you.,212
The only video anyone needs to watch about the Apple Vision Pro 👏,0
So good!,0
@3:52 Casey typing a text response while stopped on the steps was friggin hilarious.,703
"2:43 It is kinda funny that after the nice guy says ""I get off here... Enjoy your adventure"", Adventure pops up on apple tv hehe",123
This litedally reminded me of the VR guy from the Anime : Lain - Serial Experiments 😂,0
I love watching videos of things I can’t afford 🙌🙌,0
"I love how he compliments his mom, then dismisses her with a slight of hand 🤣🤣  9:35",103
"Many people have said it already, but this is such a big sacrifice to our social nature man. Phones and computers have made society lonely and distant already, can't imagine what something like this would end up doing if it caught on (I still think this will be a huge flop carried solely by channels like this and Marques' but we'll see).
Imagine walking down the street and not needing to ask anybody for any sort of information (still the case with phones but now you don't need to tell your device where you are or take it out etc), constantly being connected to your favorite people so you stop finding value in meeting or talking to new people and no one will even know who or if somebody is looking at them. Your sense of hearing and seeing are connected to an active virtual environment at all times, which we automatically find way more interesting to operate in than real life. Phones don't give us this yet we still pull them out and into our pockets several times for small trips.

I mean just look at this alone, you see a guy walking around, making hand gestures, with everybody around him wondering if he can even see them.",783
"Excellent! I agree with you - Buy Apple Stock instead of the goggles; don’t touch it for 10 years - I’m guessing 100x profit. $400,000 stock growth. But it could be insanely higher - I see home integration being the biggest improvement.  Everyone puts the ipad on the wall now - using it for security systems etc.",2
The three d aspect to the dinosaur coming out of the screen at you was actually part of the coolest saying about it.  .   .   Or maybe just sitting anywhere and pulling up things like you're on your own desktop at home with multiple screens.,0
"Casey answered the questions of the average Joe. 

Unlike any other reviewers, your content is so accessible and easily understood.",428
"This makes me a little sad. I see how cool these are but I also see technology like this making us WAYYY more disconnected with each other. Awesome video, just some thoughts abt the future of technology.",196
"Imagine the power of the advertisements in the future in this! When you're immersed in this experience and your brain starts to take it as the real world, I think that's when you're vulnerable and where advertising is going to aim. That looks mind-blowing to me!!",4
"The amount of use cases for something like this are endless. There are literally so many different ways in which j could imagine something like this being used. I really am looking forward to the feature of augmented reality. I remember years ago when Microsoft took a swing at it with the Hololense, and I've been fascinated by this type of tech since.",0
2:44 is the most genuine i’ve ever smiled at any youtube video,101
That Krispy Kreme scene was too funny. Thanks for making my day.,177
"Simula VR is an interesting looking VR Linux computer that works like that with high resolution display, passthrough, and intel i7 mobile",0
be in THE MOMENT. You do not need ten moments.,2
"I love this take. Rather than fuss over certain details, you have gotten deeper into the heads of the creators and why this is a groundbreaking corner in tech history. This was hilarious but profound!",117
We’re finally catching up to Back to the Future 2,1047
Is it safe while driving a car??  I'll try it on my comute.,1
Absolutely these will evolve to something like a pair of glasses with some kind of wireless power supply.,0
"""Enjoy your adventure"" what a gentleman!!",86
"watching it in action outside of an office room just makes it feel so futuristic, i love it.",46
That Man trying to Grab the Donut thinking you are giving it to him instead of the Dinosaur 😆,1
"One thing people will never say about it. ""You look great wearing it"".",2
the edit on the doughnut shop with Casey's POV of the butterfly versus the reality with the people around looking at him super lost is amazing hahahahahah,90
"Love Marques, but this is the BEST FREAKIN Apple Vision Pro video anywhere. I love NYC. Thanks Casey! This made my day",97
Exactly the video I was looking for. Thanks! Instead of big YouTubers just talking Your video shows the actual usage and the experience. Well done,0
Love from India ❤,0
I'll never get tired of his videos,759
"@caseyneistat what you are referring to, as the future of computing, is a future iteration of Neuralink",0
"This is the actual review, instead of just reading the manual. This has got so much perspective. I can call this piece an ART. Especially the antenna's when he is speaking about the future makes so much sense to me. Great work!!!",17
"As a Gamer like me:
this is first step for the advance future, this really fits well to exercise our body. it saves many people lives!!! absolutely agree for this , hopefully it will happen in few years!!!!!",0
"i think this is better if the hardware is in your pocket, maybe your phone could operate the same IOS.
it needs a wire so why not have the heavy hardware in your pocket.
it could also be wireless i think.",0
"This is like one of the best videos I have seen on Apple Pro yet.  I mean he is actually using it in a day to day setting.  Makes me want one, but at the same time wait till the 2nd gen.  As other have said the future looks exciting.  

However to show a video of Apple Pro in NY! On the Subway! And…..having a huge screen on the tracks with a YouTube video lol hilarious, awesome!👏",111
6:37  When your food is laced with hallucinogenic drugs.,16
"I watched an anime about 15 years ago that was this exact product, but in glasses format with intractable animals running on AI. I knew eventually we'd get there and it looks like it's starting to come together. Just need to somehow shrink everything.",0
"the first video that changed the thought of the vision pro for me is that one guy working at home who gets up to go to the kitchen and theres other windows open for how to cook something by the stove and a grocery list by the fridge, then he returns to his couch with all his work windows.",0
2:52 The window moving away when the train started moving cracked me up 😂,87
Been watching for 10+ years now and it never ceases to amaze me at how charismatic and entertaining you make everything. I love it.,67
Natural selection at work,0
Holding the donut up for the butterfly 😂,0
Seems like we’re witnessing the end of being present and mindful of our everyday moments.   People can barely survive in public without numbly scrolling on the phone.  This takes that dysfunction to a whole new level.,196
Its fun to use for a couple days max. I returned mine because it’s not worth the price and it’s entirely in everyday life.,0
This guy makes New York look like a nice place,1
"""The butteryfly is eating my donut"" idk why but i choked i laughed so hard at this😂😂",183
"Funny you mentioned Marques' review, which was a masterclass, but you captured the remaining insights that he hadn't. Impressive work.",92
"Read the books Ready Player one and Ready player Two. Not only are they entretaining but you can also get a glimpse of what could be the real future of technology. Remember that in 2001 Space Odisey you could see an iPad, in concept. Or with the Dick Tracy movies, that watch he had. The issue would be the effects on regular society, as has social media.",0
"finally, i said this to some dudes from school but they didnt understand. you get it",0
"This might be an unpopular opinion... I like taking in the surroundings and atmosphere. 

I enjoy the daily movement and grind. 

These active VR remind me of
'Wall-e'",93
Not sure if anyone in the comments has mentioned this but there is a travel mode that can be turned on so that apps stay in place.  I’d love to see how it works in a similar environment like a train or car.  Great video btw!,113
"I think that soon apple will sell advertising spaces, creating virtual times-square-like screens and signs that everybody with a Vision Pro could see in the same exact position. Each city could build a virtual ecosystem, integrating the reality. Multiple brands like meta could offer their alternative world, meaning that multiple digital version of the same urban spaces could coexist, or maybe all the companies could convey in one single multiverse. 
This is going to be bigger than what we can even imagine",0
Thank you cassey,0
Casey you have to turn on travel mode! it's in control center you CAN use windows when there is movement,45
"Pretty sure “travel mode” would solve your subway issues of windows floating away. 
Loved your video, love your passion, one of the best I’ve seen on the AVP so far!",141
"Do you still use an iPhone 5 (10:06), i just noticed",0
I'll wait for the Vision Max or Vision Ultra or Ultra Max Thank You.,0
The vision pro seems like such a cool but also potentially dangerous piece of tech. It's interesting to see how it could impact our daily lives and interactions. Definitely a thought-provoking video!,892
6:45 the butterfly's eating my donut 😂😂 dude I'm cry laughing this is somm funny,61
"It would be interesting to test this subway topic by standing paralell to the subway acceleration direction, instead of being perpendicular. I would assume it will affect differently the accelerometer readings, but anyway, I know nothing about this so, no clue if it works differently or not :D",0
you're a genius.,0
"Wow. somehow after watching you use it in public, I dont have a great feeling about it... it seems as we are isolating ourselves through this stuff more and more. But from technical perspective its amazing!",179
Remember how in games (like FusionFall) characters would just stop on streets and start typing and doing their own thing when they’d have menus open? The climbing up the stairs of the subway shot reminded me of exactly that.,106
"The age old issue of ""Sound vs Metro"". I wonder how the Vision Pro's speakers hold up against that onslaught?",0
"life is going to be so funny while walking around in a few years when theres a ton of people with these on. Especially when future versions come out at a more affordable price, its going to be a whole new world.",0
"Been watching you for years man love your style! Definitely the type of review these needed, also I didn't see if anyone else mentioned but the music fits the video so well. Bravo.",18
I'm terrified. someone please take me back to the early 2000's with my land line home phone and family computer in the living room.,52
May not see this comment 😂but you really inspired a lot of creators . I’ve been watching you since I was 14 I’m 22 now I started youtube because of you . If no one gave Casey his flowers yet well I will best creators of all time .,0
"Love your jacket, looks apart. 😉",0
"New York is a great place… I’m happy Casey is back and show casing it in a way people outside of the city rarely see. People are nice, and kind, and curious, and smile, and laugh, and it’s just magic forreal",70
I know it was a while ago but I am still so happy you are back in NYC!,262
have you tried xreal glasses?,0
This is gonna make the New York experience even better,0
"Great video Casey, glad to see you're doing well. I enjoyed watching this review. But when you sat down in the office I suddenly thought you saying ""Happiness equals reality minus expectations"". I just want you to know that I think about that saying everyday and it helps me bring myself back up to reality when I'm feeling down on myself. Thanks for that. Have a great year my friend.",28
"its a bit of fun for a video but imagine everyone running around with these things, it's bad enough no one talks to each other now being phone zombies",749
"Unrelated topic: Incredible NYC still seems to have metros from the 1970s!  I like retro, but not for the daily commute. 

We used to have similar metros in Amsterdam for traveling from CS to the Bijlmer.  But they have long been replaced by modern nicer equipment. Why isn’t the US or in this case NYC investing in new trains?",0
What if you wear glasses? How does work with that?,1
that opening shot alone . instant classic lol. only thing they’re missing is the signature spray paint !,106
"so cool to see this shown in the wild.  i’m no tech visionary but i’m struggling to see the use cases right now beyond entertainment + business for most people. it’s incredibly challenging to be present in public already with our phones, headphones, heads up displays and big screens in cars.  i just can’t imagine integrating this into life outside of controlled environments and am really curious (concerned?) about what impact that will have on both the user and those around you in terms of human connection. there’s already so many ways to “check out” at home and in private - mixing this tech in public just feels…wrong?!",38
does it have an airplane mode?  Where are the antennas located?,0
"We always ask if we can do it, but we never stop to think if we should.",0
"This is a great video Casey! I appreciate you testing the real world function of this device. I found it interesting that your reaction at the end was much different than thoughts while watching. My thoughts were that maybe we're headed down a path that will leave us more isolated and separate from one another. Is it ""boomerish"" of me to have an inclination to abstain from this type of tech?",744
I think this is a very unique insight into how public interaction in a real world would irk with devices like the Vision Pro. Most reviewers are designing at home and reviewing the device while this offers a glimpse into what it would mean to actually put the device through its paces. Very unique. Good work!,33
"Went for a demo session, amazing
glad I own the stock",1
Fixing posture but screwing eyesight even more 😂 cool tech tho. Reminds me of cyberpunk netrunner,0
"I come from southern Italy, and I visited New York for the first time last week. I must say that this video is fantastic and it brought back the same sensations I had while exploring the city. If I had met you, I believe my reaction would have been similar to the guy who encountered you in Times Square. Amazing video as always",39
feels so dystopian,18
the only review that matters :D,0
you look cool dude fr,0
"One of the best videos you have ever made. So fun and interesting, a wild experience to watch + a great story.

I loved the mkbhd videos and watched them all but your 10 minutes showed the true value of it in a way even apple cant do.",20
"gotta say, I have never commented on any of your videos, but this is hands-on the best review for the vision pro",58
do you need cellular data to use it anywhere?,0
Very robust tech demo. Best irl usage I've seen of the gadget.,0
"As someone who has been studying electrical engineering for the last 4 years, this video is fucking awesome. I can’t imagine what the future holds",37
"2:43 ""I get off here... Enjoy your adventure!"" was so genuine and sweet.",2727
I will get one of these or something similar for sure in the future. It has pretty much everything you need for home and travel needs of entertainment and work,1
"The verge review had a great explanation why reviewers are underwhelmed, they review what's IN the box, not the promise of what's to come. Casey described it as peeking into the future of computing, what they're selling right now is a just that. The true benefit of releasing this tech to the public early is that it gets developers thinking about designing for the future, and they get real world feedback from the early adopters. It is cool to see Apple entering this space, can't wait to try it myself!",10
"I was waiting for you to say ""There I was sitting in the middle of thousands of people in times square and I was simultaneously connected and disconnected from the world.""  I can't wait to see people use these while walking, biking, driving....",162
"Fun fact, if you turn on pointer control inside of the Apple Vision Pro, we can see where you’re looking and it makes it so that it’s harder for the viewer to notice the low quality rendering in the places where you’re not looking.",0
"The price is INSANE . It is a good office device combo. And for entertainment. But use it on a street or even metro - that is dangerous. Someone can steal it from you, the user can get into accident, etc. We as humans cant even properly/safely use mobile phone while we walk on a pavement without stumbling into something because our attention is divided. With this it is several times more dangerous. For home use awesome. But the price khmm. P.S.-I can bet someone will use it while driving with a car...and will get into trouble.",1
Such a kind man at the 2:28 mark. Most people are good. Spread love ❤️,63
I kid you not when I did the butterfly thing I felt it land on my hand. They said apparently about 30% of people have the same experience. Wild.,458
Used the go pro for most of the footage. It did ok.,0
finnally a new glasses!,0
"I miss casey’s tech vlogs so much, so glad they’re back!",95
You the man Casey,617
I wanna have one to but dont know what to do with it 😂,0
6:47 if you were to say that without those on people would think your on some strong stuff 😂😂😂,1
"Also, you stopped on the stairwell typing, was gold. I laughed out loud.",44
"7:25 - “I thought that would be funny.” It really was 😂 most Casey video ever, super entertaining use of the new tech!",68
the motion tracker thing works with acceleration. If your acceleration is zero for all effects you're still. So you can use it in an airplane for as long as the airplane is not accelerating,0
I wonder if it works in a car or something besides a train - that would be so cool for road trips as a passenger,0
You can tell that you are an incredible filmmaker. I mean that is like such a left field way to do a review. So good.,28
this is by far the greatest and possibly most important video about the Vision Pro that i’ve seen so far. thank you for creating it,95
"Looking at 6:39, I guess my Grandma has Vision pro inbuilt because she sometimes see stuff that we can't.",0
This is so cool 😂,0
"Funny you mentioned Marques' review, which was a masterclass, but you captured the remaining insights that he hadn't. Impressive work.",24
"Love your interactions with the precious humans of NYC. I have no desire to replace the authentic experience of walking thru cities and nature, but you still made the vid a cool thing to watch! Cheers! JB",34
How's your peripheral vision with them on?,0
6:38 Revolutionary.,0
"this is the definition of thinking out of the box, setting yourself apart. what a fun, inspiring review. Apple you owe this man a check.",88
"9:30 What you're describing right there, is a real dystopia. Imagine growing up in a world, where every morning you wake up and put on AR glasses and live out your day, then take them off before you sleep at night. Living your entire existence through a screen. Imagine, living in a town or city, but having never actually seen it. Having friends, but having never actually seen them. As seeing them through a screen, is not really seeing them. Sounds like absolute hell.",6
"Us looking at this technology is probably how people felt back then when cellphones/computers became a thing.
This is so cool and scary all at once",0
Magical and terrifying.,2
"What I'm really impressed with is your overall like-ability. Thanks for existing so loudly, bro.",52
"Casey is literally the PERFECT guy to comment on this tech. 

I think this video is so much more insightful into what this device MEANS for society than any other tech review video I've seen, and I've been working in this space for a decade. Casey ACTUALLY gets it. He's understands technology like Steve Jobs did, in the intuitive way, not just by numbers. What a breath of fresh air. 

This video is one of the best tech review videos I've seen in a while. While I love MKBHD's production value on his videos, Casey puts us into the perspective of, basically, the real world. How does tech actually influence or augment our lives, how does it fit into culture. I haven't watched Casey in years, but this was so refreshing and divine to watch.",119
There is is literally a button you press in the control center and it switches to travel mode so stuff doesnt move when you move,0
No one can tops a casey neistat video. True OG of the youtube,0
"Thank you!  This is the review I was looking for.  This review reveals purpose, reason, and the future potential of Apple and technology in general.",8
I love how you just didn't care what others thought as you filmed. I wish I could do that. I mean I guess I could just do as I pleased but I loved this video,87
that iphone 5s on your right ♥,0
The music in this video is top tier,0
This looks utterly dystopian,428
The flow of this video the explanation of your experience in this video was seriously top tier. All the questions I had and thought about are answered.,69
It is the first for headset not just for gaming.,0
"Heavy rain AR glasses, can't wait",0
The kids looking at him at that doughnut bar and smiling - such a great cut as I would have imagined this myself how I would look like seeing Casey. I will try to get some borrowed... but wait some iterations down the line to buy some... thanks for the video,61
"This is the review of the Vision Pro everybody actually needed...as always Casey, you rock!",36
It is a game changer. We live in a transformative era. In 10 years no mobile phone will be needed🙌,0
The guy on the street was so excited 😂 it was very refreshing seeing someone not being cynical or have a superiority complex,0
"You look like Back To The Future Kid 😂, i love you Casey!❤",217
"So why I love Casey, because he has his own approach of how to make videos. That's why Casey has always been and still is the best youtuber, he has pushed YouTube to this level. When I met Casey in real life, he pleasantly surprised me with what an energetic and interesting person he is🚀 

The idea behind his video seems simple, but his pitch is very unusual🔥🔥🔥",73
Mind blown 😳,0
"For those of you about to venture into AR/VR, get ready for the very weird feeling of taking your headset off after being in VR for a few hours to a dark room. Case speaks truth to how your mind adapts to being in VR and it feels really weird to take off after a long session",0
I watched nearly every Vision Pro video by now... This has been the most valuable one! Thanks Casey 👍,24
You took us there! I can see the future for sure. And your excitement was palpable. Really enjoyed this.,8
I find it so funny when you say to people ur to much on your phone 😂😂 they always come up with bs,0
Question when you wear this all day people need glasses  much faster in the future?,0
"So great to see you again!  Great video and take on the new device. I understand that feeling completely. I haven’t felt this way about a device since the announcement of the first iPod. So many similarities. At the time, millions of mp3 existed, took batteries (kids used to steal the batteries from the calculators in class) and no player cost more than $100. Then the iPod dropped. Same happened when the iPhone dropped. CNET’s review was hilarious. Claimed it was dead on arrival, no physical buttons, no stylus, no upgrade able memory, and too expensive. Now there’s a whole industry completely saturated and nearing the end of its innovation. This is the first headset I have seen that gives a glimpse into the possibilities. Just having control over the image projecting to others has huge implications and possibilities. I’m so pumped, seriously. You nailed that feeling of excitement in your video. Beautiful work as always. Loved it!",15
Only 1:20 into the video but Casey’s refreshing style and down to earth mentality already makes me smile and happy 😂❤🎉 Keep it up. Always great to see how positive and friendly react to Casey 🙏 tolerance is what the world needs right now.,9
Did he return the vision pro device?,0
"interesting dailies content, keep up on this kind of videos lol 🤣",0
Hey great video! Best review of the Vision Pro I’ve seen. I was thinking it wasn’t for me but I can see the appeal now.,10
"Casey, I love the video and I’m glad you came to a similar realization that I’ve had regarding computing in the future! I HIGHLY recommend the book “Warcross” by Marie Lu as it has a little bit for everyone while going deeper into the future that I believe you’re talking about, if your not really into video games, it might be a bit of a stretch to read, but it’s honestly my favorite book that I’ve ever read. 
Have a good one!",7
"I think once batteries and all the other tech here get WAY smaller and this is just a pair of glasses, they'll be sweet. I think Apple should have shot for just entirely AR, less immersive glasses first, but they kinda dove in the deep end which I guess is fine.",0
I had the same with Quest3,0
I love this review and the take at the end. Most of all I look forward to seeing how they shrink it down to the practical glasses size and how we solve all the problems required to accomplish it!,5
Most relatable review I’ve seen on this “$4000 ski goggles” yet and that is no easy feat with all the 1000’s of reviews out there. Way to stand out from the crowd Casey👍🏾,65
Use travel mode to keep screens stationary,0
Do they come with data or does it just piggy back off of phone data?,0
"This is possibly better than a full review, since it shows whats its like in your daily life. 
A lot of great moments in this video
Awesome video!",41
2:43-2:53 made me burst out laughing. I feel like the still frame with his hand sticking out is the average experience.,48
"I clicked on your video because I think you are cooler then Marcus. Love your videos man I'm a big fan 

I love you too Marcus 🩵",0
"Think about the first computer you ever saw and think about computers now. When I saw this, I felt the same way",0
"What a great review this is what i wanted, a real perspective of things.
This reminds me of when people started talking in microphone headsets in public and everybody looked at them like who is he talking to, and this genuinely scare me, this is the last stop before we go fully immersive and wave goodbye to human connection.",11
"Hands down one of the best videos you made lately, Casey.",29
Good review! The future is now!,0
"8:15 What you see is reality.  Technology like this enhances reality. Reality is comppsed of everything you experience through your senses, and what ""sense"" your mind makes of it. Just one way of looking at it.",0
"Casey is think this is genuine modern art. The shots and editing made the video come together really well. 
One of your best I’ve seen in a long while. Thanks for the laugh 😂",117
World is going to be just another Black mirror episode,23
I assume it comes with the fluorescent safety jacket to prevent you from dying in traffic?,0
"do they night vision ,thermo or xray vision?",0
"I don't think I would ever have a need for these use conditions, but I'm really glad to see what they would be like if I did! Thanks!",9
"You taking these AR ski goggles out into the real world really gave us a glimpse into what the future of television, the internet, and interfacing with technology. AR glasses that function like these Apple Vision Pro's would be a game-changer. Great video Casey!",35
"6:30 this right here is most amazing and funny moment  with today's technology 
The is the [Foreigner Vlogger visiting another country]",0
"I don't know why you didn't discover it, but there is a travel mode that tracks the screen throughout the moving journey in that subway clip.",0
Casey is back!! Loved ur vidoes back high school and still love your vidoes after 2 kids now watching together!,11
"I’ve used cheap oculus with 2k resulution with games like no man’s sky and the immersion is insane, it’s one of those things where you have to try it to understand. I can’t imagine how amazing the Vision Pro is.",15
You can lock your windows to stay in your perspective while moving,0
You should have enabled Tracking Mode,0
"Very big ""Classic Feeling"" vibe in this video, Love it!",25
The best review ever for this product ever on YouTube. And I think he just made history with this video! Period!,104
Everybody saying that it doesn’t cost 4000$. But it’s amazing you can take a small piece of future,1
I'm envisioning a future with loads of Pokémon hunters on the streets when these things become smaller and more affordable and honestly I hope I will be one of them instead of being the old grandma hating on all these changes cause I think I'd be happier with my charmander beside me.,0
"Wow, what a remarkable video. In real time, Casey evolved this piece from a ""funny reactions to weird AVP nerd"" story to something much more profound: ""the AVP provides (surprisingly) a decent look at the future of computing."" Bravo. This makes other AVP reactions/reviews appear shallow. Bravo.  🔥",26
"Fantastic video Casey. I love your perspective showing the awkwardness and absurdity of the present versus the future potential.

My wife also made a great observation about her fears of people never being able to disconnect.",14
What is this jacket? Similar to rail station staff at London Waterloo.,0
Just shows you that we are truly in the end times. Another step farther away from reality into total 'disconnectedness' with your fellow man.,0
"This was the Vision Pro review I was waiting for.  While I appreciate other’s review, they all feel very safe and in a controlled environment.  As someone who lives in NYC, I appreciate you taking this to the next level which is the realistic chaotic day to day use in the real world.  Thank you!",8
"I always love watching Casey interact with New York, and watching New Yorkers interacting back to him, the love both ways it’s always amazing to see. Always makes me want to visit",14
"No one:
Goggle guy: “The butterfly is eating my donut”",0
Ever thought of going for  a run with that thing on casey,0
Casey killed it. This is the kind of review/narrating that has been making him so unique and popular amongst Yters.,17
"Best review so far, great job thinking outside the box!",7
"9:20 

Elon Musk: ""..already way past that with neuralink...""😂❤",1
Does it come with flippers?,0
"These types of videos show such an important part of the picture. What the (future) real world experience of owning one may become. Hats off, this was fantastic.",30
This is by far the best non-review review of this thing. Casey is such an incredible storyteller,16
So everybody can be living in their own independent reality side by side to each other,0
Casey can try Apple Vision Pro where you visit some country.,0
"Casey just finds so many different and inspiring ways to enjoy things. I would of never imagined using this thing
and walking around a city with it on.",31
"I love it! But the scare thing is, I scare people locked into their phones back to back to back. I'm just thinking about what happens when they are wearing these. Or even scarier when they drive with them on. Phones are bad enough",19
"I can see people experiencing derealization from this, similar to what you can experience when taking drugs. I'm scared for what's held in the foreseen future.",1
"Jordan: ""No - 'thasnk' you Casey, my pleasure"" 10:26",0
"I don't know how this works, but literally every of Casey's videos has this magical touch to it. Makes me really appreciate the king. To the Vision Pro: It seems to be as amazing as it is kinda scary to have products like this entering our lifes, changing how we perceive reality. How we interact with our surroundings. It truly is surreal to be a Sci-Fi fan currently to have this mindboggeling technologies really at our fingertips - assuming you are willing and able to pay those HUGE prices. Future truly is here and I'm looking forward how the Vision Pros change the VR market and which crazy others products will be the result of it",47
"I would not want to experience it like this at all, but I love knowing how it would work and seeing it demonstrated. This is a very important video for tech in general",21
"2025 :
Covid: i sense something dangerous
Vertigo outbreak : get out its my turn",0
We need a new studio tour,0
I think the funniest part was waving your donut around with the butterfly and people watching you😂😂😂,24
100% the best review iv seen of this thing. A real review,9
"Buying in to the apple watch 1 honestly not too bad..  But buying in to this, is absolutely ridiculous.  I'm waiting for the vision pro 8 at least before I drop that kinda money lol",0
lmao this was one of the best of Casey's videos in years! His social anxiety level is in the negative,0
"Bro. I am wordless I've got nothing to say but I really enjoyed Casey's experience of the Apple vision pro... I felt as if I were with him. Thanks, Casey.",15
"I think what everyone forget to say in their review is how lonely the world will become when VR can feel that real. 

We won’t be able to psychologically recover from such a shift. Humans are made for human interaction and this stumps that growth for communities, communication and social skills in general. It’s such a sad direction the world is moving in",49
"Casey, waiting from you to check out bionic lenses , you gonna fly for real",0
It's only the beginning!,0
"It has been a long, long time since I have subscribed to someone for their personality and style alone. Thank you. (This is the first time I've even seen you btw)",18
Real sadness… this is foreshadowing a bleak future… a deeper self-alienated presence… being evermore removed from the other… social awareness slowly becoming irrelevant… pushing more and more people (especially youth) into the arms of despair and depression… mistaking connectivity for genuine connection… 😢😢😢,95
first i watch u videos is 20k suscribe but now is 12m wow 😅,0
The elegance and sophistication of Sofía Vergara's Los Angeles home are truly captivating. A testament to impeccable taste and style.,0
"I understand the excitement around AR, but seeing people walking around with these on their heads reminds me of a show episode, maybe Black Mirror, where a kid was diagnosed with a new form of depression. One where they inundated themselves with so much visual and auditory input from online media that they couldn't regulate their emotions, and deactivating the device they used to view all of this - a wearable - basically flicked off a switch and they'd sit there shy and near catatonic. What I'm afraid of is training ourselves into a syndrome similar to phantom limb syndrome; one where without our phones, we feel naked, and without a window opening when we make a gesture, we feel vulnerable.",76
"The whole time I was thinking how awkward it was to transition from your screens to walking again, having to walk through them. But that dismiss gesture you used at 9:37 would be perfect. Hopefully they implement that at some point!",7
the advertisers are so excited about this :D,0
😂😂😂 this is absolutely ridiculous hilarious 🎉🎉🎉,0
"Yes, you said it perfectly. This is a glimpse into the future. Fantastic review",6
I think you figured out exactly where we’re heading. You’re the only one I’ve seen so far who really got it. Great video!,115
Casey takes the goggles off and realizes he was in his apartment the whole time,2
"""Enjoy your adventure"" Ah. The best. More of this people. MUCH more of this",0
This review actually gets me excited for future tech!,26
"Ah yes people’s sense of awareness to the real world and being even more distracted is just what society needs! 

This was a great video but I really don’t think we need screens in front of our faces all the time.",205
I would be so distracted I would most likely walk into a wall.  lol,0
"Ready player one. 
Here we come.",0
"Finalmente o tipo de analise que eu estava esperando, os outros trezentos mil vídeos todos iguais, e o cara aí fez o diferente!",6
"Best review I’ve seen so far, best take. Can’t wait till vision 2 or 3 maybe 4 when there small enough to wear all the time",7
Ready player One ...... here we come!!!!,0
It's like ready player one came to life,0
"This is the video I wanted to see about the Vision Pro, it really shows the potential! The others reviews are the copy of the copy of the copy",14
This is the one review that Apple never wanted made but it is the one that was needed. I see it now and the future looks bright.,28
This is like wall-e where everybody was stuck in the floating chairs stuck watching shows and eating,1
I'll buy it when it comes in a more discreet version - like Casey's sunglasses.,0
By far the best review of tech product on YouTube and I'm watching from Zimbabwe,11
I haven't laughed this hard in a while. You have made the best Vision Pro review ever. Great job as always!,7
U can pick the windows up & walk with them with your hand. So they don’t go away.just grab them.,1
The Krispy Kreme part had me in tears.,0
"Finally, finally I found a review of this product which really makes sense!
Oh, and by the way:
Your antennas look awesome!",37
The contrast editing is the best part’s of the video,8
Have to turn on travel mode for the windows to follow!,0
"seen little clips of those things but bumped into this video now i know wtf they are now, i thought they where playing some sort of games on it walking in the streets trying to touch the sky for whatever reason",0
"Dang, we've gotten 3 Neistat videos in a month! It's like the olden days!! Thanks for the review!",16
"This is terrifying. Having all that life around you, and not seeing it. Such a shame.

The cuts in and out of the virtual space was so jarring and telling of what will be missed.",18
Everyone will turn Italian soon with those hand movements. Mama mia!!,0
Make it the size of sunglasses or a DBZ scouter in the next versions.,0
"The donut shop part is hilarious, I dont think I could get the courage to walk around NY with a headset on lol",72
Honestly you’re spot on with what you say about this being the future… and that scares the crap out of me.,11
"CASEY! Have a look at the NREAL XREAL AIR 2 GLASSES! they are what you are dreaming of, and have been out longer than these! can you please review them?!? You probably wont see this, but if you do. would be awesome!",0
Is it always recording what's infront of you?,0
Half way through and it's already the best review of this thing.,15
"This attracts me to watch, not a boring unboxing. This gives another level of experience in real life.",9
I cant really tell if i want this future,0
I love his next level advertising,0
This is probably best advertisment apple could make. The end of this video is brilliant. Thank you for this rewieve it is best one that shows everyday experience of a future.,61
"It has been a long, long time since I have subscribed to someone for their personality and style alone. Thank you. (This is the first time I've even seen you btw)",21
"The fact it doesn’t work on a moving train makes me curious to see if it would work on the ISS that travels at the velocity of 28,165KPH",0
Don't think I could do this with the Quest 3. Getting very William Gibson,0
The best review I've seen so far on this matter,7
"caught you on a morning run early 2021 in Cali, in a beat up Honda with a big ol goofy smile haha! bring back the jogging clips in the videos. thats life!",6
Next time you’re on the subway (or passenger in a car) try enabling “travel mode” to disable the gyro.  Then your screens won’t go flying past you.,0
can i drive with the apple vision pro?,0
6:46 The scene with the butterfly and donut makes me laugh.... 😂😂😂,41
"this is the best review ever, we need more YouTubers to do reviews like this
great video",13
Now imagine that tech but with no goggles and you control the internet with your thoughts and move the iron man screens with your hands or your thoughts if you cant use your hands.,1
Good move with highviz 😂,0
"Every review of this product is the same, until this one! No greater content creator for creativity, imagination, and utility. Casey is the man!",12
"this is the best ""review"" I've seen yet of apple vision because it shows how it could actually be used in day to day life.  all other reviewers are in a quiet still area like a bedroom or room.  you really tested it.",51
Ya this is just what the world needs 😂. Everyone walking around with these on in 5 years. Oh god I wanna go back to the 90’s.,0
"interesting dailies movies, keep up on this kind of videos lol 🤣",0
legendary video will be remembered and referenced for a long long time. the guy's reaction on the train when you told him you were seeing him was priceless and something future generations will look at with a smile.,10
9:10 Casey points out this is the future interface for all computing; where ambient display interfaces are all around you.,6
Casey texting on the stairs is as hilarious a imagined that scenario being.,0
"Can't wait to se this technology solve big part of the social network isolation problem! And even to be able to paint and engineer on to the real world, to see shared world wiews",0
"Seeing you in NY… my wife and I love to travel. What if…. Tours— interactive tours of cities, monuments, landmarks, could all be presented here. On the Apple Pro! Getting the motion thing fixed when moving, I’m sure will be an update or new on 2nd gen. Cameras look awesome, but finer detail on next gen. It’s all going to get better. And wildly better. 
I can’t afford this product, as a lot of people can’t. But would love to try it and see where the tech goes!",5
Yours(real world) and Marques(technicalities)has the best review on this product.,8
This is going to be everywhere soon.,0
I'm waiting for the apple vision contacts,0
I’ve been waiting for the one review video I actually care about. Thank you Casey! Also love mkbhd!,18
I like how respectful YouTubers are to each other in the US,18
What is the little green dot that appears every now and then?,0
So it's safe and legal to drive while wearing this?,0
"Every architecture studio should own this to present their vision to clients, there is no better way to see it. Weather it's inside or outside, vision pro could cover it perfectly 👌",10
"I've seen so many reviews of this thing, but this one blows them all away",15
I know when Casey goes out and about in the hi-vis it’s going to be a good adventure,0
Is that iPhone 5s on your desk still working?,0
"For someone with Lazy eye,If you have lazy eye, you can change settings to use your one eye to track and point , you won't be able to see 3d well like normal site & if you switch eye it will try to focus",7
ive been watching casey for almost 10 years now...theres been about a 3 year stint of me watching his work...but this video made me miss the creative spark he always had in his videos and short films...he really is a creative genius and knows how to portray a story through video,9
"Can't wait for Apple vision pro ultra max high capacity VR to come next xD
Or just apple vision pro 2",0
Now imagine talking to someone in the street like you’re actually interacting with someone. Crazy,1
Been Waiting For a Real Life Aspect and of Course Casey Sends It,17
"Seeing you in NY… my wife and I love to travel. What if…. Tours— interactive tours of cities, monuments, landmarks, could all be presented here. On the Apple Pro! Getting the motion thing fixed when moving, I’m sure will be an update or new on 2nd gen. Cameras look awesome, but finer detail on next gen. It’s all going to get better. And wildly better. 
I can’t afford this product, as a lot of people can’t. But would love to try it and see where the tech goes!",5
"The video I needed to watch
The closing comments are statements I already considered, but hearing them here was definite reassurance
Can’t wait for future models !",0
"I bet these things were never meant to be operated on the go, more like a indoor experience. But you showed how ridiculously looking tue future would be",0
And after 5 years we will cry looking at this thinking good old days those were,6
10:08 that’s such a good point. Indeed it’s gotta get way better. Buying stock seems a good investment (if you’re able to),6
the way you type . seems weird i could get use to a system like t9 on my fingertips would have been much faster,1
thansk,0
The first two minutes were hysterical. I laughed so hard at the closeups and you just standing around poking the air.,10
This is the best IRL review of the Apple Vision Pro.,11
casey talking about marques and watching mr beast is iconic thing of some sort,0
"Dude, great review you got me excited thinking about the future of how well these devices will evolve, and Apple being Apple will most likely create exactly what you showed with the sunglasses! Technology is amazing, and is only going to get better!!!!!",0
"i do see how this can be incredibly useful for certain people such as with hearing loss or alike and probably in other cases too, but honestly this looks so dystopian it's insane.",44
As someone who loves tech I do worry about where this will lead. Trouble is no one else does.,53
I was hoping the profound moment was going to be around the end of human interaction and physical engagement :( that’s what I felt as you explained where you were,0
"Casey mentioned he had a larger battery pack for the Apple Vision Pro , but there is no mention of an extended battery anywhere. Casey , please let us know ....",0
This technology will ultimately disconnect humans even more from society when out in public.,12
"bewildered while looking lost in reality , the music is the cherry on top 😂",9
"I am here. Trying to be as disconnected as possible from my phone. And this things just keep you connected to it. Ironic 
Next level is, you connect yourself to another device that give you the feeling of touching, so you can stay home, sitting down. Workinf and havinf your life there. No need to go out.",0
I want the cyberpunk eyeball,0
I love the “They Live” vibe you got going on with this video,7
"Awesome review of the Apple Vision Pro, Casey!  A lot more expensive than my Meta 3!  Never seen a review on foot in the middle of Times Square!  Hopefully I'll see you someday now that I live in the city!",22
Wonderful !. Very wonderful !. Wow !. I can say about Apple Vision Pro is the best. You can see the best you can. Wow !. Amazing !. Very amazing !. If I have it of couse very happy. Everything the best I can see !.,0
"Better wait for next versions, these glasses looking like a giant Fly, a handle a
giant mask, it looks like that first Iron Man armor and that power source that the scientist mounted on Tony Stark, on his chest, with a cable connected to a car battery. LOL !
It's best to wait for a more updated, reduced and lightweight version.
But for those who like to show off and show off, this is a great option hahaha",0
"This is so ridiculous, I love it! I'm so shocked that it's so useable in the real world, I'd never imagined it being used like this. The butterfly scene had me crying!!",35
3:05 I'm pretty sure the Vision pro has a feature to counteract this - it's called Travel mode (located in control center).,7
Feels like ready player one,0
The doughnut butterfly LMAO,0
This was unexpectedly the best review of all of them,6
"This is the prelude to Surrogates (2009). I think the idea of wearing this is handy but not in public. I really loved the video though, Casey . Thank you millions!",19
"All those people who were staring will soon start to wear this as it will become mainstream, this will be the future.",0
Back to the Future 3 with VR and tons of screens,0
"Damn Casey, you truly made want to buy it in the first minute... your gift in production and everything is beyond amazing.",8
"This is honestly what makes the device appealing- portability and adaptability to its environment, good review!",29
6:31 had me dying,0
5:40 I’ve said that word for word on mushrooms I think haha,0
"I plan on getting one, i think i'll wait a couple years. It seems amazing.",123
The fans at 4:30 are a prime example of the law of attraction bro 😂😂😂,7
"It kinda looks like someone wearing snowboard goggles all the time.
I kinda wish if they separated computer bits from screens and put them on the belt strap and connect it with cable, that way they could make goggles smaller even maybe make them looking like a sun glasses or something.",0
Reminds me of AR in Pokémon GO! 😂,0
This is the most sincere review I have ever seen among all the others and I completely agree with everything you said because it was the first thing I thought... in a couple of years this vision pro will be ancient.,9
"The one thing I think I’d love to get Vision Pro for, would be to watch YouTube while lying down. But I can already do that with my Meta Quest 2, and besides, the Vision Pro doesn’t have its own YouTube app, but the Quest 2 does.",6
Casey Makes The Best F'n Videos 😂,0
"it's longer than 15 years bro. neuromancer came out in like 89. sure people had ideas about portable vr before, but really as a workable concept and where computing was really going and in the mass media? yeah since 88 or 89 i'd say. i mean i've been waiting for it that long for sure.",0
"""NEXT GUEST! NEXT GUEST! NEXT GUEST! @ 6:22 LOL! My goodness! Chill out LOL!",8
This is totally bonkers. Like the part tat 6:48. The butterfly is eating my donut. 😂😂😂. This made my day.,14
Imagine everyone was wearing these and texting ? I feel like someone is going to run into the subway or fall backwards by mistake or get vertigo,1
you gotta tap top two buttons and it'll stop tracking via gps,0
This is probably the best review of the Vision Pro because Casey was able to articulate and show the real promise of the product: this is where future computing is heading.,5
"If this is the future, it makes me sad",20
"I remember hearing Casey talk about how anytime people ask for a picture with him, he takes their phone so he can take the picture cause otherwise people want to retake a bunch of times so he was like “fuck it I’ll do it” 
It was funny to see that in action in this video 😂",1
🔥,0
I think you figured out exactly where we’re heading. You’re the only one I’ve seen so far who really got it. Great video!,8
"I'm an Android user, and I love my Samsung Z fold phone, which is one of, if not the most innovative phones out there, and I make sure to let my Apple friends know that nothing new has happened to iphone in the last 9 generations. But THIS... now i see where Apple has been spending its time and money and their vision of phones does not disappoint. 
Bravo Apple 👏 I'm sure Jobs would approve.

Casey, awesome review. This helped me better understand the utility of this new technology and it seems a lot more versatile than just a gaming VR headset",7
"This is very cool tech but i cant imagine a real happy society if we all had a pair of glasses that augmented our reality just like we do with being glued to phones all the time. That amount of constant simulation turns people into bots when used long term. Its a great way for media to use market and condition people into spending money consistently without a massive cost of investment from the business owners perspective. 
Just personal opinion, and everyones got their own, but i see products like this doing a lot more damage than they will do good. From a scientific and innovation perspective, it is absolutely awesome though",0
"This... THIS is how you show off this product !!

Not in a studio, not in an office... but when you have virtual monitors open, doing work in the middle of times square !",0
This is also the peak of where humanity goes down hill in the majority of sci-fi movies 😂,15
I love how much everyone is so happy for him. I love it when other people are so curious and nice when it comes to technology.,9
Not sure if the future is exciting or scary,2
"Well, that is terrifying.",2
THIS IS INSANE!!!!  Such a trip to watch this.  The way you did this video really shows the “this the future” aspect of this device.,6
This video is like old casey neistat video! I’m your subscriber since 2017,27
@YouTube why am I not seeing Casey's videos on my fyp? I have to look for Casey's videos,0
Is it worth it if i dont have apple phone,0
"i think this really is THE review for an average person. thanks for this, really enjoyed it!",5
It’s really sad that we are already glued to our screens most of the time. Most of these tech companies want to take most of our attention to suck us into their ecosystems. This videos shows where we are going and that makes me really sad for the future of humanity. There’s reality and people around him and he seems fascinated that he can take his work outside instead of leaving it at his desk.,9
what about the front cam??,0
like there should be a button on ur back that u need to press against the back of a chair for there to be a display,0
"Not sure if Casey always does this, but notice how he had his hand in the position of the Apple spatial computing motion 8:56",6
Casey's enthusiasm for the future is unmatched. I feel like I learned more about Vision Pro from this video than any other so-called tech review channel.,42
"Oh, wonderful!  An expensive device which enables you to see a dinosaur video in a donut shop!
Just what I always wanted!",0
I love how he's able to make NYC feel charming. When I go I feel disgusted. But it looks magical when he films and interacts with the city,0
"There's been many videos on the pro. But to walk around and use it to find out what its really about rather than staying in a controlled environment was inspired. 

🌟",5
"I am not sure I have seen one of your videos before and  if this is a typical example of the quality, then that has been my loss. You youngster, have produced one magnificent piece of contenet right there. Total props to the producer/ideas person and the team for following it through. Nice one.",9
I can't wait till it gets eyeglasses size.,1
Feel like apple vision goin to become norm just like headset soon and I probably be 80 by then.,0
3:43 is exactly the kind of lunacy I expect to bring society as we know it to its knees.,5
"The thing that will make it go wild is when they let you share AR assets with another headset
When another person can see, and interact with the things you see",6
"So, Apple advertises it as an outside device or is it just for the marketing purpose?",0
Crazy that you Can Film every Person in New York,1
"Pretty cool for a 1st iteration, excited to see how it evolves over time",12
"I used to work at Google when Google Glasses were released. I had a chance to try them twice. Exactly the same fascinating experience when you see those screens floating in the air. But Google Glasses didn't use the camera; they did not cover the view at all. Unfortunately, the project was shut down.
So I wonder why there's a confidence that Apple Vision Pro will stay longer? Were we just not ready back then and are we ready now? I remember tones of criticism about privacy, ethics of recording someone on the street without their concerns etc.",9
"For what I hear there is a travel mode, IDK why nobody knows how tonise it",0
"this is literally dystopian. with the way this is going, Cyberpunk 2077 seems like a pretty accurate prophecy",0
by far the best review video ive seen on these,7
This video shows so many things. Why Casey is the OG YT legend and a pioneer in story telling.,16
Imagine that. You wear your google like those. You are living in your appartment but with a filter. Your appartment look average but with the google you see a penthouse. ✌️😜😎💪,1
"Imagine pausing Dune in Time Square, getting up for a donut, come back and someone has taken your seat…",0
The Krispy Kreme bit was hilarious. I’m terrified for the future.,18
Nooo he left his open tabs in the middle of Times Square,5
Honestly I'd be scared of getting them stolen or someone doing something while I have those on. Even if you can see they do limit your peripheral vision.,0
"it’s been much longer than 15 years, william gibson coined the term cyberspace in 1982, and this is the first time something has almost equaled his groundbreaking science fiction.",0
Your videos give me such good nostalgia,12
"I like how he puts a spin on it, not just another apple vision pro video, also thought this guy quit making videos but apparently not, awesome as always...still hate apple products tho!",5
If the screen relay to video in real time you have here the true birth of main player character,0
The butterfly’s eating my donut lmao,0
"6:32 yes, so the butterfly killed me xD this is the review we all needed.

Greeting from germany",10
5:07 curling two fingers probably not the best gesture to be using in public,8
Im waiting for the Apple Vision iBalls.,0
9:12 it’s called NEURAL LINK. This gadget is just a little preview.,0
"10:13 ""It is going to get so much better"" 
And don't forget MUCH cheaper.",7
Now that is how you review and test a product...in a non controlled environment doing normal activities. I wasn't impressed with the Vision Pro indoors but as a mobile device it's the future. Once it's smaller and they make a version under $2500...it will be a must have travel accessory. Great video and it made me see this device in a whole new perspective,5
"Reminds me of how much technologies need to learn and converge, and maybe the convergence is happening. Remember google glasses?",0
I hear all the ways this disconnects us from reality!   I play VR co-op video games.  I have met and talked to people from all over the world.  Some have become friends.  What a small world it is now thanks to technology - use it wisely and it will benefit mankind.,0
"4:20 We're not worthy, we're not worthy.",9
"Someone at one of our tech conferences phrased it so wonderfully. The moment the technology disappears, only then does it become truly useful.",64
I’m joining the Luddite Devolutionary Front. You guys go have fun.,0
They will try to implement it into our brains 😊,0
I don’t see how people don’t see the issue with where we’re going as a society. Good luck y’all ✌️,14
"What you expressed at the end of the video is how I felt when the first iPhone was released. I had been dreaming about a phone that worked that way, and it happened! It was exhilarating. That said, I don't know if the world is a better place with the iPhone because it's part of what's disconnected us from one another. Seeing you in the middle of Times Square with a mask on, watching multiple screens, and answering texts seems like it will lessen human interaction even more. I think it's interesting you picked Times Square as a place to demo this. I love the theater, all the New Yorkers and people from around the world visiting. That's my preferred multi-screen experience. Thanks for always posting interesting, entertaining, and provocative videos.",7
"imagine someone has the ability:
to effect your day for the better or worse 100% of the time
would consider that to be your time?",0
"Very cool, but since Apple & tech companies love to gather data, basically the users should evaluate the features benefits vs real life data Apple will be observing and gathering via LiDAR and all the cameras on these goggles ! Now it’s not just locations or conversations, it’s visual perspective !",0
"I've been having the AR multi-screen experience for a year using a pair of Xreal glasses that cost less than $300. It's not the pinnacle of this kind of tech, but for like 7.5% of the price it's been a game changer for me.",9
"When Apple announced this product with a long video, I remember having this weird feeling of being uncomfortable about how it might change the world. I felt like what it might have been when the internet or a computer first came out.. didn’t really understand it, but looked like something revolutionary. I think your the first ‘review’ video I’ve watched that has validated my original thoughts",9
This is the most significant invention literally since Issac Newton discovered E=MC.,0
"that's Odo, from Star Trek: Deep Space 9",0
0:15 literally every Casey video,10
"Casey:  ""I guess you guys aren't ready for that, yet. But your kids are gonna love it.""",5
THIS is the future.,1
Its giving me ready player one vibes,0
"As someone who has been studying electrical engineering for the last 4 years, this video is fucking awesome. I can’t imagine what the future holds",18
"""Enjoy your adventure""... 'Apple Interactive Adventure' pops up as the suggested watch. Always listening. Always.",20
looks like Kramer inteacting with the world!,0
What if we start calling it the AVpro and you could just say. I have my AVpro’s on right now.,0
What everybody needs in their life is EVEN MORE INTERNET.,7
7:02 - that is peak Casey.,5
NYC's kindest strangers,0
So now we're walking with a suped up phone on our faces now,1
The feeling of having your digital world integrated with your real one is hard to put into words. This is truly a step towards the future of computing.,48
Am I the only one terrified of it if crowds wearing this?,5
pokemon go with this would be crazy,0
Spacial computing is AR.,0
6:30 🔥🔥🔥😂,8
"I was the fifth person at Apple in Tigard Oregon to experience the Apple Vision Pro. Being 73 years old  I thought I had seen everything. I was wrong.  20 minutes Into the demonstration I realized I was experiencing the very edge of a new future. Once the clumsiness and the weight of this technology are conquered, we will never look back.",28
I like to touch things.  I Ned hepatic feedback.  The vibrations of my phone on my fingers or of the keys clicking on a keyboard are too important to me.,0
I can imagine this will probably be some kind of implant or glasses which sync to our phones in the future.,0
the paparazzi @0:30,6
5:19 In Brazil the guy would be dead in 0.001s and device stolen.,6
But can you read the tiny text on those screens?,0
Yeah I am 100% sure AR will be adopted by many but once the size of the glasses gets much smaller,0
"Ok. I've watched all the apple vision pro videos. This was the best, this was the one that SHOWED not TOLD me about the product. That's the best way to do a review. oh and holy crap this product is insane.",5
"Everyone is so focused on the technical details and short comings of this 1st gen apple vision, and seems to miss the actual point that this is going to change everything in the next decade. Casey excellent video as usual, this is the type of review I’ve been looking for! I’ve been dying to know if it works when out and about walking around outside",5
It will be like when the iphone first came out it'll be werid at first but eventually everyone will have one,0
This is the best review. It's kind of insane that you don't hear about some of these flaws from other people. That fear of not getting more stuff to review the next year is real...,2
9:36 😂😂😂😂 hey mom yah I’ll call you back you look great btw *SWIPES AND HANGS UP* 😂😂😂😂😂😂,9
These are truly the future. I agree.,83
the glasses should clear when u lean forward to stand up,0
Google Glass walks in... Hello There,0
7:18 SIIIIICK!!!!!!!!!,6
"MKBHD who? Damn Casey! You did it! You always do it! This is some of the greatest Tech review I have seen in decades. This is what a Tech review should be like! Since the launch of these, and after watching a few videos on these, I was like what the hell is wrong with people, it’s like everyone was gatekeeping something, something they don’t want us to know. Haha. It’s just a product, use it and tell us how you feel about it. How simple is that? Now more than ever, I feel like I definitely see myself buying these and using these every evening instead of watching a TV.",11
"Why is apple not just letting go altogether of the keyboard and program it to understand in the air 10 finger typing, like how you would type on a nornal keyboard, it should be able to predict what you want to type, it’s already good enough to detect a pinch to select things, of course a pinch is a less subtle movement, but if they let you type a paragraph first and correct it wherever the algorithm got it wrong, the algorithm can learn your specific finger movement and get it customized",0
That headset makes you so muggable!,0
Omg this is ICONIC. What a way to use a cultural moment and merge it seamlessly with all things Casey and bring it to the streets of NYC 🤩,7
the donut scene was one of the best moments i have ever seen on youtube,7
"yea, I'm interested to see what the 3rd or 4th generation of this tech will look and perform like. Probably much smaller, more effective, and cheaper. Meme's are making fun of this device but I won't be surprised if almost everyone has a device like this in 5-7 years",0
"Using it in public would be great if it wasn’t so goofy looking. If the somehow got it down to the size of a pair of sunglasses, it would be world changing. Even if you have to carry external components to achieve it.",0
"In 10-20 years, when these guys become common glasses, I will come back to this video and remember the start. This is actually awesome. Gives me E.D.I.T.H. vibes and I love it.

I never owned any Apple product for real, but this is a great evolution.",20
2:43 “I get off here… enjoy your adventure.” what a guy. Apple needs that guy for PR on this device!,8
"And we thought that people had already lost all of their social skills with being stuck to their phones, but it looks like things are still gonna get even worse.  God help us all. 😩😩😩",1
"Anyone noticed how after the man said ""enjoy yout adventure"" it pops out a movie recomendation wich says ""adventure"" 😅",0
"10:27 u spelt thanks wrong, just saying 🙃",6
"Bruh. Imagine using this as an Italian…
You meet you friend and speak like this 🤌🏻🤏🏻🤌🏻🫴🏻🤙🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻 and the next thing you find out is that the Vision Pro opened a thousand tabs, ordered pizza and the next Uber ride to the Colosseum 😬",6
"Lets create a world where no one has any REAL situational awareness around them. Very cool tech, but extremely terrifying negative impacts on society. Smart phones have already destroyed so much of human interaction. This is on a whole other level. If this tech gets popularized, there are going to be huge impacts in both a safety and social aspect.",1
Dopamine give me more dopamine!!!,0
I could never walk around in public with this thing on,16
Legit nobody has the creativity Casey does.,6
It's an old classic in eternal unfinished development technology.,0
"imagine someone who's never heard of the Vision Pro just seeing this random guy stabbing the air in the middle of a staircase, or seeing him put a donut to the sky talking about butterflies with zero context lol",0
3:56 reason u shouldn’t buy lmao,7
This world is doomed.,10
WE NEED DUEL MONSTERS,0
Seeing what people see it looks like it looks amazing but as someone with glasses I am going to have to say no to this. I’ll let y’all catch up to my terrible eye sight with this 😂,0
All I know is Steve Jobs would never give anything like this a green light,10
We’re so fucked.,13
"Imagine someone wearing these, and watching videos on their phone in the subway 😂",0
is like a skateboarder calling on invisible kittens,0
Eddy was right. Jesus.,5
Society is fucked.,14
I'm surprised you're still in New york. Dont you have a bunker somewhere?,0
It's a start of new Era just like when Steve job released IPhone and world was never same again.,0
I will do one pushup for every like this comment gets. (I promise.),1037
"Its insane, but I honestly think these things are going to be as common as a cell phone. 
Spacial computing is cool but it'll be the end of the human condition as we've known it.
Sounds melodramatic but its the truth.",1
This is how we will end up disconnecting with reality. It is terrifying.,2
Casey’s new Ray Bans are crazy 😂,0
"Next are glasses, then contacts. It's couldve been done already but I guess it's the money",0
It feels like an episode from black mirrors,0
"Reminds me of Wall-e, the movie, where people would stare at their screens all day, so much, that they forgot how to live and experience real life.",0
can nearsighted person wear it ?,0
This video is going to be so funny to watch in 10 years,1
I  wanna go on a skate with you,0
"""Enjoy your adventure"" What an NPC like interaction lol",0
Me thinking what I would do with the apple vision pro mean while I don’t got the money,1
The number of people who took a photo of you 😂,0
Amazing technology but I really hope it doesn't catch on!,0
Im getting H3H3 Peep n Creep vibes 😂,0
In 10-20 years these videos will be such a goldmine of comments that didn't age well,0
"This, indeed, is the future, and in the next decade or so, we’ll look back at how big these headsets were and laugh.",0
0:12  he looks like ODO from DS9,0
"I can see a world where this becomes the new court appointed ankle monitor. where they would live sensor the world to stop interacting with people or things, like alcohol would be impossible to see. Then areas would be off limits like driving the wrong way on a racetrack “reverse” “out of bounds” “turn around” … followed by a zoom call to your parole officer.",0
All your videos seemed to turn into long commercials now. Used to have good content now just commercials for huge companies,3
we werent ready for google glass,0
"He said this is the worst one that apple will ship, it’s just going to get better. I don’t know, I’ve had every I phone made over the years almost snd none of them are that much better than before. Screens are bigger, that’s good. Camera gets a little better. But the format is the same. It’s the same old same old. I have the 14 pro right now. Apple seems to stick with their own style without much change. If those things get better, forget about human interaction. The whole civilization of humans will become something it wasn’t when I was a kid in the 70’s. Hell, there weren’t even cell phones. The drastic changes in human behaviour and technology in my time is phenomenal. Night and day difference in how people are. And I’m only 47 years old. We’re all going to be ai in fifty years if we keep going down this road. That being said, I want one now lol. Very cool",0
:awesome:,0
why do I feel sad than excited? 😢,0
"Uummmm, skiing trip?🤷‍♂️",0
"Pretty much the review will be ""Damn! This graphics is so real!""",1
The interesting thing is you can easily see people behaving exactly like Casey is here in times square minus the headset,0
Phone already destroyed my focus.. i cant imagine having this in my life 😂😂,0
Total recall x10,0
So interesting,0
:awesome,0
Turn on traveling mode 😅,0
"great for public transportation, long flights :~)   but we will see lot of dummies in our country driving with it and doing crazy things..  also it will make it so creepy if more and more people use it in public",0
His windows are still floating at Times Square🤣,0
he's living in the future 😮,0
I can’t believe you touched the handrail as you went down the subway,0
"The future will come soon, for sure or maybe it's happening right now :0",0
Where the sound goes since you dont have headphones ?,0
Remember Iphone 5?  When AVP 15 released out probably its already beyond imagination.,0
"They will come out with a ""Stake"" to use while in the car driving or whatever.",0
"Haha these things look so ridiculous.. is it worth replacing your phone with? The stopping on the stairs and focus on it doesn't seem as practical as texting and walking lol, plus with voice assistance on everything, it really is impractical.",0
Imagine being so much a celebrity that strangers just hand you their phone,0
The perfect peripheral for solipsists,0
"I am sure google will copy immediately the idea, because when you walk into a store the can implement marketing gimmicks or even as simple as pulling out a menu at restaurant",0
I think this highlights something that only Apple or Google could ever sell to customers because they have their walled operating systems and apps that go across all possible form factors. Meta can't compete with that.,0
anyone else notice the guy taking a picture of him at the start lmao  0:28,0
San Fran has a Fentanyl problem. NYC has an Apple Vision Pro problem,1
yeah...I don't think is gonna be safe to walk outside with that thing haha,0
I can see an interesting version of this like a football helmet 🏈 though. Like every one wears an NFL helmet. Like wireless and all. And Americans like football 🏈 ..,0
I love you Casey,0
"Someone is disconnected from reality, as if people need to be disconnected any more.",1
"I get the idea of augmented reality but this just seems a little too encapsulated. With the wealth disparity/opioid crisis going on I don't think if it's a good idea for people to be walking around wearing these while experiencing limited peripheral vision. Cool technology though but holograms seem more viable., I'll stick with the Ray-bans.",0
This won't really catch on until they can put it in a contact lens.  Cool tech though.,0
Still amazed how you can skateboard while wearing the Vision Pro.  My goal would be to walk to the kitchen without falling down.,0
alternate product name for creeps riding the ny subway: gooner goggles,0
"Did you not read about ""Travel Mode""?  Turn it on, and the screens will stay with you.",0
Should have made the battery rest around the neck instead of that long cord.,0
lol...butterfly moment,0
Imagine having someone wearing this in front of you and not realizing they are recording you!,0
"How everyone is just openly staring at hi. They don't even try to hide it😂
Social anxiety fears this man",0
That should be their new slogan. Enjoy your adventure! -Apple,0

There will come a time that how we view brick phones now is like how we view these,0
waiting for google glass to get up to speed and revive it!,0
"3:10 There were wetting water, now there is kinetic movement.",0
Seems excessive. It’s good to unplug. I miss my long subway rides when I’d read a book or draw,2
This is brilliantly terrifying,0
Disconnecting humans even more from the real world like phones didn’t already do enough damage,0
"Tech addiction , damn !this is scary in a weird way",0
"I don't think the goggles will ever be ""the future"" motion tracking is great but our brains can only be so stimulated. I think multi display network machines combined with screens or projectors will take over.",0
Ready Player One 😁👍,0
It makes sense to pay 4k for it if one can get 4k out of it in value.,0
Imagine meta and apple joined forces and created a virtual world togehter,0
"10:08 ""This will be the WORST Vision Pro Apple ever ships"" 
Beating Apple in their own game xD",0
One can only hope this device doesn't become a thing,0
Yo that lady on the train might want you or just very curious 😂,0
"This is what we need. More people in their own worlds, obviously to all humanity around them. For all those people who love this VR stuff, you still need to eat, 💩, breathe, etc. There's no escaping that--at least for the foreseeable future. LOL",0

"Ready player one is becoming reality, next we be in submersible pods full time",0
Just imagine once these are everywhere how much access the government is going to have to all those cameras 😂,0
In a couple years these will be everywhere…,0
"To quote the late David Foster Wallace, ""the technology is just gonna get better and better and better and better. And it's gonna get easier and easier, and more and more convenient, and more and more pleasurable, to be alone with images on a screen, given to us by people who do not love us but want our money. Which is all right. In low doses, right? But if that's the basic main staple of your diet, you're gonna die. In a meaningful way, you're going to die.”   But yeah, enjoy your adventure Casey.",4
It's exciting stuff but I'm not wearing heavy ski goggles all day.,0

i thought a was looking at Kevin the Minion lol,0
"Is it just me or this is scary to imagine what the future will look like? I mean, we are already so disconnected from Real Life Interaction due to social media and connectivity. It seems like real human interaction will slowly fade and mental health will be an even bigger issue than it already is.",0
Looking forward to people randomly stopping in front of me to respond to texts oblivious of surroundings.,0
Who else is waiting for the video when Casey decides to customize Vision Pro  like he does his Ray-Bans?,0
We’re in the future😳,0
"It saddens me that as a species we have not yet learned our lesson. Look around, our world is crumbling from the inside out with the technology we currently have already. The idea that continuing to separate and isolate people into their own little realities is going to be beneficial is absurd. Like everything there will be pros and cons, but how many suicides and how much division and how much disease from sedentary lifestyles will it take before people finally understand that “progress” in the wrong direction is not progress at all. The people who make these products and the powers that be want mindless, isolated consumers who feel like they need to escape reality, take medication and continue chasing after the next shiny object that will ultimately leave them feeling more empty than satisfied. Just to buy the next version a year later. And that is what they have and will continue to get so long as people choose to ignore the reality of the situation we find ourselves in.",0

They are not going to be able to make that small enough to create what you are envisioning.,0
We already have our phones in our faces 24/7 and now they want us to get further into the SIMS life. No thanks.,1
"The one thing no one will say: ""that was a smart purchase""",0
"This is not exciting to me. They're preparing us for the pods, so we never leave our house.",1
CASEY ...just to let you know... wearing this device ...while driving your car... either in the US or here in the Netherland... you get a fine.,0
words cannot express how much I hate the idea of the future Casey is getting excited about.,1
Bro he proved that we could be  living in a simulation when he said his brain clicked and forgot that he was wearing an apple vision pro,0
"If I'm honest, as much as people talk about the future being VR/AR, I just don't see it. I like reality.",1
"That is about as anti Apple Vision Pro as it can get. No body would want to touch this thing now. Seeing him wear it publicly actually shows how clucky and ridiculous this thing actually is. 

Apple wants us to video chat with ultra glossy, hyper airbrushed korean skin digital avatar, when we all have access to group video chat. WTF?",2
What I see is a more expensive Holo Lens that is less capable than the one I tried out about 7 years ago.,0
"Instead of saying that tracking has failed, why doesn't it just disable tracking?!",0
"Maybe great for home office, but real life going fully online is just sad. In 100 years let’s say, I think there will be those that are in this online reality and those that have chosen to say as humans were made and experience ‘normal’ life",0
"Give it 5 years, everyone's gonna be walking around with one of these on",0
"Incredible, when this technology will a be standard i will ask  girls to talk to put a filter on me  so that i look less disgusting. Truly amazing.",0
“Hello im from the future” guy wearing apple pro.,0
There will be privacy 🤔,0
"People are gonna get robbed so easily, getting lost in the different worlds and not paying attention",1
Y’all no way we’re not gonna be annoyed all the time in the future when everyone is shooting video from their POV 24/7!,0
"To quote ready player one - ""I realized, as terrifying and painful as reality can be, it's also the only place where you can find true happiness. Because reality is real.""

I hope people don't forget this ...",0
"Anyone else excited for IRL video games? Where the real world becomes like an MMORPG? You get to a certain corner, a quest pop up appears in your field of vision, you start it, some wizard pops up, you talk with him IRL, and then have to go to a new neighborhood to find the key, explore the city to find the chest, and get the treasure? hehe",0
When this becomes sunglasses size... Its the end of human interaction 😢,1
Comes with a snorkel?,0
"When you are watching a vid like that dinosaur, can you see someone behind the image aiming a fist? Asking for a friend",0
"Read the book 'Caves of Steel"". While it looks cool and everything. It's just another mechanism to isolate the individual and make them more controllable. You only thought Big Brother was watching you before now. With these, they'll know everything you 'think do and say'.",0
"I cannot use windows when I walk!!  It's never enough. As if we aren't distracted enough, and you wonder why everyone is stressed, panicked and have low attention span, we can't be still or quiet. So sad.",0
"This video will live on and in 30 years people will look at this and think that shake their heads over how primitive, impractical, lacking and basic enhanced reality was back in the day. This is the beginning. This is like when the first cell phones started popping up. Most really didnt have a use for it then, it was impractical, but look at us now.",0
if only the people around him knew what he was experiencing,1
"Crazy futuristic but at the same time also quite scary. You seem to be all disconnected to the real world while wearing these goggles. Also, I feel like there is a lot of room for error in terms of safety when you distract yourself with so many interactions. Suddenly you might miss a car passing by or sth.",1
Buy Apple stocks and next year that investment will pay for the latest version of Apple Vision. :),0
How can u hear without headphones?,0

"A wave of novel mental illness and sensorimotor disorders are going to hit harder than humanity is prepared for. People think they are depressed, confused, anxious and lonely now... just wait. This is literally the beginning of the end. We were not designed to interact with the world like this. We will learn the hard way.",2
i thought he was done doing YouTube or was it just another stunt. i hate living in a world and time where people get famous for nothing but i congratulate you individually,0
Remember your Google glasses? Me either..,0
I guess you didn't use the travel mode in subway....but than you would have to properly test it before chasing viewers as fast as possible....,0
"dude use travel
mode you can move",0
"We need a new term to replace glass-holes.  Do people enjoy reality anymore?  We spend half the day on our phones, but tech companies feel this is not enough!  Disconnect please!",0
Beautiful women walking past but i cant make eye contact with them and flirt with them because im busy using tinder on my apple vision pro,1
Reminds me of serial experiments lain..,0
Annoying pedestrians glued to their smartphones is going to be nothing compared to when the masses are wearing this 😅,1
Missed opportunity to wear a futuristic 5th element type of outfit.,0
The whole time watching this I’m thinking about his personal safety. Wearing these things in any number of situations causes you to give up situational awareness on many different levels. Very dangerous.,0
"This looks so weird. God our reality is getting stranger than fiction. I'm a techie nerd, but at this point, I hope someone would push pause on the tech advancements.",1
And I thought phones were a distraction,1
You can literally do all this on the quest 3 for a fraction of the price.,0
The Chosen One in The Matrix only had this technology in sunglasses,0
"So .. the thing people won't talk about is how these are too bulky and expensive but someday they won't be ?
I mean .. I hope that's true, but I am skeptical.
The laws of physics being what they are and all...",0
"Apple: Vision Pro
Microsoft: Hololens
both promise the same thing. Only one delivers.",0
Lets make whats inside a video about this and cut it open want to know how it works..,0
this is like the first iPhone,0
The butterfly is eating my donut.,0
Yeah I'm sure people will use this tool to be more social and not at all become more self-centered and shut-in... Great tech but at what cost?,2
6:46 LCD moment,0
Well someone loved NonPlayer,0
"These things are so freaking cool.
I'm really excited to see where we go from here.",0
A year ago you wore the same jacket to test the AI electric shoes. No one is wearing those and no one will be wearing these.,1
"This is as disconnected from the world as it gets. Super sick tho, the tech is wild.",0
"ok.. who is this guy??? why is everyone pumping this guy up, he doesn't even find the right words to describe his experience.. this guy has 12 million followers wtf..",1
The stepping stone to Brain interfaces. No Robocop screen for me thanks. Wearable tech is a precursor to having that tech inside you…,0
I'm worried what this will mean for humans interacting on a human level... It's already hard enough trying to get people to engage and focus on the here and now as it is,0
"…and I’m over here thinkin; at some point soon in the future, there’s only gonna be two types of people in the world when Dad gets back…. 😏",0
Apple vision 3 will sell like hot pancakes. I’ll wait for that.,0
"Technology is getting very scary by the minute, and I don’t know how I feel about it.",0
"Nothing like being online 100% of the time and being completely detached from reality.  No thanks.  That thing is a terrible idea.  I though social media was bad for humanity, this will be a million times worse.  Throw it in the trash where it belongs.",1
"Great review but... Apple knows that cyberpunk stories are cautionary tales, right? Not inspiration?",0
"people will get away more from real life interactions because of things like this,most of us are already salves of smart phones.. its so sad.",0
Lol you know you look crazy when people in NYC are giving you side glances.,0
"Unfortunately, using this in Brazil on the street, thieves steal from you.",0
RIP all other reviewers🎉,0
The butterfly is eating my donut,0
"Damn, this just puts content consumption into a different kind of addiction level. Putting the phone down is such an essential thing to do now, but so challenging for most people. And this? Wtf bye bye actual human connection and creativity from boredom.",0
Isnt this exactly what AR is?,0
dude never used a quest headset b4?,0
What about a person who wears glasses???,0
I’ve been reading & watching reviews and there’s no doubt this thing is awesome but $4k is a hefty price tag. In typical apple fashion they’ve unnecessarily inflated the price of their product.,0
"For all the criticizers: you said the same thing about the radio, the TV, the telephone, the internet, then smart phones, and now you are saying the same thing about VR/AI: that it will ruin society and lead to our doom.  Yet with each evolution in tech, you eventually integrated them into your lives and it has now made us smarter, more connected, more efficient, and more creative then ever before, and this next evolution will only maximize our potential even further.  Embrace it. This is going to allow our dreams to become literal reality.",0
This is wrong on so many levels and dangerous for several reasons. Also I'm curious to see the effect it will have on people after 15 years on the skull shape lmao like headsets have,1
"Imagine when eventually everyone has these, but they're not goggles, they're fuckin CONTACTS. And everyone is wearing contacts that can do all this shit everywhere they go. It's definitely gonna happen in like less than 5 years.",1
I think we are becoming more disconnected just having phones in our hands and this will make it 10X worse! Sad world it is leading to.,0
People are going to become even less good at dealing with reality.,3
"Yeah, this product is like the Lisa, way too expensive but so revolutionary. I'll wait for the ""Mac"" version of this... cheaper and smaller",0
bro use travel mode,0
"Um....legit, your own mind can do this.....this device will level the field of psychosis though.",1
this seems dangerous to have in public. oh your watching a show in front of you and then start walking and you dont see whats behind the thing you are watching. also if you wear headphone you dont ear your surrounding. also you just might get muggged for your  headset. also your periferal vision is reduced also if yoou dont wear air pods your just gonna annoy everyone with your video you are watching,1
"Your video is way better than Marques B's video. I turned it off, it was boring.",0

All what I wanna say while watching this as a European…. This is America. 😂",0
If people start walking around with these things Everything Will Be Recorded. Everything. All the time.,0
This is absolutely fucking horrifying,5
me watching this on a 7y old tablet :D,0
I still think the quest 3 does rhis better imo,0
Can i watch PINKY XXX ?,0
He’s gotta be wearing his glasses underneath right?,0
Every time I watch a Casey Neistat video I love NYC a little more.,0
"The question…
Why is the real world not good enough for people anymore?",1
"Who would wear these in public?! It’s the new version of A-Holes that would walk around with their giant Bluetooth in their ear. I’m glad they’re balls deep in their devices, means we don’t have to interact.",2
With neurolink its gonna be nuts,0
Can't imagine the world in 500 years from now.,0
*For $3500 Id rather just glimpse at a screen occasionally...*,1
$3500 to look like a high-tech homeless person wandering around hallucinating.,1
So you can walk around watching videos and ignoring everyone around you. People are already too unaware of their surroundings when they are walking around.,1
This tech will be in your RayBans within the next decade and you will be able to buy them 60 a pop at the gas station.,0
Take a Subway Back to Close The window,0
"The atomisation of our society is complete.
Oh, and say goodbye to your teenage kids.",1
It's honestly creepy how everyone on the subway just starts secretly filming him.,0
man what happened to flying cars and shit in the future this feels more like wall-e and shit,1
"When the true beauty of the world has finally left, and we've lost sight of reality, at least we will have Apple Vision. The WALL-E existentialism is really hitting in 2024",0
"What an easy way to get mugged, while you immursed in your virtual world.",1
"The title ""this is the thing"" was never shown. What is ""it""?",0
8:34 Sounds like a new drugs experience,0
that man was NOT getting of there. he was moving to another subway car,0
In a couple of years they will be like contact lenses,0
"But if we’re overwhelmed with information using our smartphones, why would we want this?",0
That’s a good way to get jacked quick on the streets 😂,0
Why does he look like a minion tho 😂,1
Welcome to black mirrors season one,0
This fucking  crazy casey omg!!!,0

It looks like ready player one,0
Pined screens is nice to be coupled with GPS you could pin screens at any place in the world at real time or previously at home.,0
Just loved this,0
Eye contact R.I.P,0
So the future is us all stumbling around like drug addicts.,3
"Apple has turned the Earth into a virtual world, haha!",1
i tried making this tech(not a big company tho) and they should just be able to switch on tracking while moving. apple devs are probably car brained,0
"I was actually talking about the fact that information is being transmitted around us and through us 24/7 with my 13 year old today, he couldn't quite grasp that. This product shows it is possible to actually interact with it in a real world scenario instead of stopping to look at your phone every 5 minutes, it enhances whatever part of the world you want it too.",0
*Coughs* Accel Wolrd,0
"the crazy thing is that this is just the minimum viable product apple was willing to release, right now. its not neccesarily the best apple can currently produce",0

This is terrifying.,1
This is quite sad tbh,1
No! Please no! We need to stop before its too late.,1
"This dude looks like Shawn Pen and I can't get over it. I can't watch because it makes me realize we are in a simulation and there are so many avatars we can pick from. Even if nature is the operating system there is still only like 16 types of people you see in all Cities when you travel, and nothing is different. This person is an example of this and its scary to look at them.",0
There are definitely a lot of dinosaur in a donut shop.,0
Average Black Mirror episode,1
"Lol idea is cool, just look so weird when wearing it in public though.",0
Your like a walking Robo Cop 😮😮😮,1
Businesses will have VR advertisements that only people wearing these can see.,0
Yea walk around with a $5000 blindfold on in a city known for broad daylight robberies. Brilliant,1
Apple choose a wrong way...,2
"If that is the future, tnx but I am out. I am fighting against present, there is no money in this world that would make me isolate myself even more from reality while looking like a clown in the process.",1
“The butterfly is on my donut” sounded like Joe Biden,0
"This is so sad and pathetic it’s beyond words. If people don’t know how much this technology will create a world of sick people walking around looking like they are insane and having no connection to their own humanity, we are doomed. Why did you run all of those marathons and inspire so many people if this is the kind of world you want to live in? Wow. 😢",1

this makes the entirety of black mirror look like a story written by an edgy 13 year old on wattpad.,1
I wonder the main bam of this video🤔,0

Everybody is going to look like a cyborg in 10 years when prices drop and the goggles get a bit smaller. Can't wait.,0
"Someone please save us from this insanity. Yes, you looked ridiculous.",2
This future scaresbthe shit out of me...too much disconnection.,0

"whoops, there was a window in front of that bus, is what you woulda said but u died",0
"Whats the point of these? It'll go down the same road as 3DTV... the price point alone means it's not an option to the majority of people and as ""newer and better"" models appear the price is only going to go up..",0
The one thing no one will say is that it’s worth it that is it’s worth $3500,0
I'm confused. Oculus quest has existed for a while now but why the heck does everyone in america seem to think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread?,0
I thought Casey would have more integrity than to watch a Mr. Beast video lol.,0

It bothered me that he was pressing every key on the keyboard when he could just look at each key and pinch his finger or use speech-to-text lol,0

We have to resist this shit a little bit..,1
But if nobody buys them it will flop,1
If he didn't have to vision pro no one would pay attention to him. A society without love but hypocrisy,0

"Sorry... but Meta's stock has been almost doubling eversince... While Apple's going down. For a $3500 product, it's not much of a technological leap from Meta's offer. Sure the camera and screen are better, but isn't that a consequence of a much higher price?",0

Even more burn-outs incominggggg,0
I’ll hack it if they turn them into actual glasses I’ll build programs too help the military,0

"The only problem with Vision Pro it's ..... Apple.   to enjoy this headset you must be an Apple fan geek. You need to have a MacBook or an Iphone 14-15 to be able to work with this headset.  If you are a PC/Android user than this headset is not made for you.   Apple's next headset will be released in 2027, which will give time for the competition to crush Apple. I'm willing to bet that Meta will come out with something that will crush the Vision Pro. I think with VR/MR we'll hit a plateau, because the technology isn't evolving that quickly.",0
We’re all doomed.,0

The game changer will be when your brain is hardwired to the internet.,0
Happy to patiently wait until they figure it all out.  Waste $4K on a silly toy?  I'd rather save the money or donate it to people less fortunate.,0
I hate the future. I’ll take a hike in the woods over all this b.s. If these tech nerds don’t cut down the last tree of course.,2
I’ll say something people are saying shout Apple vision pro: why? What the fuck do we need to answer text in the middle of the street for? Why the fuck do we need to consume more content at the subway station? Fucking lunacy,0

"google smart glasses, but looking goofy",0
I have an idea. Why not enjoy the real world? Too many people are shut off and distracted by technology instead of using it to enhance their lives.,0
bro is dirty jobs of tech,0
"Long story short, it makes rich people more obnoxious to poor people in the wild.",0
"This thing is impractical and looks like a huge safety hazard. It's so bulky, and it's distracting enough to make one not be fully aware of their surroundings. People already spend too much time online, and this looks to only make it worse. We're looking at a new generation of brain rot, and chronically online people who are detached from reality",0
"Cool video. But..This is only going to make the world more disconnected from reality than it already is. Hate to say it, but as amazing as this technology is, it’s dividing us even more than we were already. Call me a cynic but I’m scared for the future because of this. People need to look out for each other more and focus less on this consumerist shit. This will only encourage people to indulge in their own selfishness. Anyways, that’s my take on this. Fin.",0
I see so many more car wrecks then there already are in the near future.,0

hey Casey I'm not sure if you will see this message but just to let you know I searched up my birthday with famous people on Google and apparently we have the same birthday😂,0
We don’t interact with people much now anyway so who cares if you look foolish wearing these around. Just another normal day on planet earth. Great review and I’m excited for this product to develop.,0
Looks ridiculously stupid LMAO!,0

Holy shit this is lame,0
"I mean, it would be practical if it didn't weight a ton and make you look like a total douche. Also for that price you can get 7 Quests, which are lighter and have more developer support. So really just an overpriced vr headset with no apps.",1
this thing is a complete bs and a waste of money. many people are now returning it (you have 14 days to return),0
These things are SO STUPID and for the price...,0
I can complain or I can adopt !! I am going to adopt this new reality where change is the only constant  .,0

Buy Apple stock now!,0
I think I'll wait for Samsungs version cause Apple sucks,0
I can think of some Sus things to do with this Headset. You know it I know it everyone knows it. Im just willing to say it.,0
"If this would actually catch on, then the Vision Pro is going to be like the first iPhone. Compared to what iPhones are like now, it sucked. So just to imagine what a 2041 Vision Pro would be like...",0
completamente innecesario 👎🏻,0
You looks so weird and sad with these...,0
Yeah yeah yeah.. yada yada. I almost puked. It's not anywhere near future when you're like going for a snorkel in middle of times square. That shit would've been invented eons ago. I mean it's Apple. Everyone knows they're a step back at true innovation. Dum tech like that already existed years ago. 6 DoF with sadly stuck at 90 Hz refresh rate? People could easily stick a Raspberry Pi Zero or the Orange Pi Zero to a snokeling gear and have tracking installed. VR/AR easily coded in Unity 3D. =P .. Overhyped bulky piece of junk,0
This is stupid and unnecessary.,0
This is the dumbest thing I’ve seen in a long while. This is the modern Newton. I used to have a Newton. Fancy but useless. Steve Jobs would never have approved this.,0
Trash,0
Apple sucks. Apple customers suck.,0
Apple has never been the future of anything. These are a gimmicky toy at best,0
